They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."]

Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24.

Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal.

Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups. Support groups are moving online, and there are a lot of different support lines to call if you need to talk to someone."]

When we are stressed, we usually know what we're stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself.

It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life.

Stress is usually caused by external pressures we’re having difficulty coping with.

Anxiety, on the other hand, is usually caused by worries or fears about potential threats or troubles, or even anxiety about the anxiety itself."]

If your feelings of sadness resolve themselves on their own over time and don’t impact your life in a big way, you’re probably not dealing with depression. That being said, if you continue to feel blue, it’s important to seek help, as depression doesn’t usually go away on its own. Depression is much more than low mood or sadness.

Others may choose to stop taking their medication because of its side effects, without realizing that most side effects can be effectively managed. While it may seem reasonable to stop taking the medication, the problem is that most often, the symptoms will return. If you or your child is taking medication, it is very important that you work together with your doctor before making decisions about any changes in your treatment. Another problem with stopping medication, particularly for stopping it abruptly, is that you may develop withdrawal symptoms that can be very unpleasant. If you and your doctor feel a trial off your medicine is a good idea, it is necessary to slowly decrease the dosage of medications so that these symptoms don’t occur. It is important that your doctor and pharmacist work together to make sure your medications are working safely and effectively. You should talk with them about how you are doing and if there are side effects that make you unwilling to continue treatment.

A “Brand” name medication has a patent that allows the manufacturer exclusive rights to sell the medication for a certain number of years. “Brand” name drugs cost more because the pharmaceutical company discovering the drug is attempting to recover the hundreds of millions of dollars it took to do the research to make sure the drug is safe and effective. Other costs involved with brand-name medications include manufacturing, distributing, and advertising. When the patent time for a brand-name medication runs out other manufacturers are allowed to make and sell “Generic” versions of the same drug. The active ingredient(s) of Generic medications are identical to the “Brand” ingredient(s) though the tablet or capsule may look slightly different in color, shape, etc., and generally is less costly.

It helps with psychotherapy because the hypnotic state allows people to enter a deep state of relaxation that can better allow them to explore painful thoughts, feelings, and memories they might have hidden from their conscious minds. In addition, hypnosis enables people to perceive some things differently, such as blocking an awareness of pain. Hypnotherapy can be used in two ways, as suggestion therapy or for patient analysis. 1. Suggestion therapy: The hypnotic state makes the person better able to respond to suggestions. Therefore, hypnotherapy can help some people stop certain behaviours, such as smoking or nail-biting. 2. Analysis: This approach was historically used to induce a relaxed and uninhibited state to find suspected unconscious causes of a disorder or symptom, such as a traumatic past event that a person has hidden in their unconscious memory."]

It should be used for pain control only after a doctor has evaluated the person for any physical disorder that might require medical or surgical treatment. Some therapists use hypnotherapy to recover repressed memories they believe are linked to the person's mental disorder.

Vitamin B deficiency could negatively influence your memory function, and cause cognitive impairment and dementia. Vitamin B contributes to the complexity of depressive symptoms.

Sometimes it seems easier to ignore your feelings when you’re struggling, especially when it feels like you have no one to talk to. Take some time to acknowledge that things are hard.

The natural light can help to boost your mood and the vitamin D in sunlight can ease symptoms of depression. 3. Reconnect with your interests. If you find you have more time to yourself, think about what solo hobbies you used to enjoy or always wanted to take up. Pursuing a new hobby can redirect your mind and give you something positive to think about. 4. Check in with people you know.
