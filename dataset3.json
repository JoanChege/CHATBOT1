They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a person's character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brain's biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."]

Then, work with your social networks to make a plan. You might video chat with your close friends in the evening and phone a family member once a week. Remember to be mindful of people who may not be online. Check in by phone and ask how you can help. The quality of your social connections matter. Mindlessly scrolling through social media and liking a few posts usually doesn't build strong social connections. Make sure you focus on strategies that actually make you feel included and connected. If your current strategies don't help you feel connected, problem-solve to see if you can find a solution. Everyone feels lonely at times. Maybe you recently moved to a new city, are changing your circle of friends, lost someone important in your life, or lost your job and also lost important social connections with coworkers. Other people may have physical connections to others but may feel like their emotional or social needs aren't met. Measures like social distancing or self-isolation can make loneliness feel worse no matter why you feel lonely now. Reach out to the connections you do have. Suggest ways to keep in touch and see if you can set a regular time to connect. People may hesitate to reach out for a lot of different reasons, so don't be afraid to be the one who asks. Look for local community support groups and mutual aid groups on social media. This pandemic is bringing everyone together, so look for opportunities to make new connections. These groups are a great way to share your skills and abilities or seek help and support. Look for specialized support groups.

Anxiety, on the other hand, isn't always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself.

It can also go by different names, such as clinical depression, major depressive disorder, or major depression. Depression can come up for no reason, and it lasts for a long time. It's much more than sadness or low mood. People who experience depression may feel worthless or hopeless. They may feel unreasonable guilty. Some people may experience depression as anger or irritability. It may be hard to concentrate or make decisions. Most people lose interest in things that they used to enjoy and may isolate themselves from others. There are also physical signs of depression, such as problems with sleep, appetite and energy and unexplainable aches or pains. Some may experience difficult thoughts about death or ending their life (suicide). Depression lasts longer than two weeks, doesn't usually go away on its own, and impacts your life.

In addition, hypnosis enables people to perceive some things differently, such as blocking an awareness of pain. Hypnotherapy can be used in two ways, as suggestion therapy or for patient analysis. 1. Suggestion therapy: The hypnotic state makes the person better able to respond to suggestions. Therefore, hypnotherapy can help some people stop certain behaviours, such as smoking or nail-biting. 2.

Psychotherapy. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can help change your thinking patterns. In a form called exposure and responses prevention, your doctor will put you in a situation designed to create anxiety or set off compulsions. You’ll learn to lessen and then stop your OCD thoughts or actions. 2. Relaxation. Simple things like meditation, yoga, and massage can help with stressful OCD symptoms. 3 .Medication. Psychiatric drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors help many people control obsessions and compulsions. They might take 2 to 4 months to start working. Common ones include citalopram (Celexa), clomipramine (Anafranil), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac), fluvoxamine, paroxetine (Paxil), and sertraline (Zoloft). If you still have symptoms, your doctor might give you antipsychotic drugs like aripiprazole (Abilify) or risperidone (Risperdal). 4. Neuromodulation. In rare cases, when therapy and medication aren’t making enough of a difference, your doctor might talk to you about devices that change the electrical activity in a certain area of your brain. One kind, transcranial magnetic stimulation, is FDA-approved for OCD treatment. It uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells.

It’s so important to feel wanted as human beings, that when we don’t get that feeling, we can go to some real dark places. \n\nI would say that it’s not unhealthy to think the way you’re describing- it’s actually probably a sign that you’re brain is functioning, socially, at a normal level, because it understands that it’s missing something in the relationships you have. It sounds like a pretty reasonable coping mechanism, to me.\n\nWhat is NOT healthy is that you don’t feel validated or cared-for in your relationships. That one is harder to address, for you and for someone over the internet. You deserve friends who care about you and listen to you, and you deserve to feel fulfilled by your relationships with others. If the people around you can’t do that for you, I would say those aren’t not healthy friendships, and perhaps taking steps to find better relationships would be a good place to start (I know- easier said than done). \n\nIf the fantasies stem from a desire for people to care about you, but you feel unnerved by the content, you could try to imagine scenarios in which you do good things for your friends that make them pay attention, such as saving them from a speeding car or taking care of them while THEY are sick. I don’t know if that would help, but it might be an interesting thing to try. \n\nBottom line is that I don’t think there’s anything wrong with you, besides some friends who seem not to treat you right. I hope you find some genuine friends, the kind you deserve, and in the mean time, I hope you don’t beat yourself up too bad about your brain’s coping mechanisms.

    "responses":[ "Aww, thank you. This is a really nice reply.\n\nI do have the fantasizing in which I’m the good guy\/helper as well as this stuff, but the thing is my friends already appreciate me in that sense. I just changed schools and this year has been my most successful social year — it’s more like I feel I *can’t* talk to them, and then that manifests into the other thing. But self-awareness isn’t enough to just make the feeling go away.\n\nI went to extensive anxiety therapy that worked like a charm, but when we got onto the topic of depression it didn’t really work. My mom also decided that I was cured and I agreed to end the therapy, because alongside singing classes it amounted to a lot of muns. My mom is very caring, but she’s also a hotheaded know-it-all that believes she’s always right. She’s very opinionated, and it’s hard to approach her with this stuff because I have no idea how she’ll react. A few years ago I told her I was depressed, I got yelled at for threatening her with suicide — a few years later and alongside the therapist I told her, and she was all “oh my bunny why didn’t you tell me? I’ll always be here for you”.\n\nSorry for the tangent — basically what I’m saying is my friends do care, but people my age don’t really know what to do with that stuff. I do have one friend  who’s always the sweetest person in the world and cares when I say “hey, I’m feeling down”. People *do* care (even if they don’t know how to reply, or they think it’s a joke), but for some reason I can’t let go of the thought that everyone hates me.\n\nAnd as an example:  a very, very close friend blamed it on age when I approached her with it, but we’re really good friends and love spending time together.\n\nI don’t know where I’m going with this I’m tired but thank you you’re very kind :)"

Say you understand not wanting interruptions, but maybe she could cut back on how often she watches it (once every 3-4 days instead of daily), or how long (say for 30 minutes instead of an hour, or 20 instead of 40, or whatever). The articles above point out the negative impacts of \"staying in the loop\"], as you put it, so they'll hopefully help. And you could see if she'd be willing to read more news - on her phone, for example - instead of watching it. This A) means you can avoid it easier and B) is better for HER as well; *reading* the news makes it easier to process and has less of a negative impact on mental health than *watching* the news."

It can be really hard to think or focus during a panic attack, so make it very simple. \nFor example:\n1. Stop. Take a deep breath in your mouth and out your nose.\n2. Go to a bathroom or an empty room. Shut the door. Sit down (on the toilet, on the floor, whatever)\n3. Take 5 deep, slow breaths in your nose and out your mouth. \n4. Listen to your music.

It's not so much a therapist just saying something that helps, but helping you restructure your thinking patterns and how you view yourself.\n\nI will also say this - you are worth it. It is always worth bringing up with your doctor. This is a chance to feel better. And sometimes it takes a few tries to find a good therapist, but it is never a waste of time, because it is a step towards finding the right therapist and starting to feel better. (Also, most therapists will chat with you on the phone briefly to help you get a feel and see if they could be a \"match\"). Feel free to PM me or comment if you want any advice for finding a therapist or anything else. I have an unfortunate amount of experience with finding therapists and psychiatrists."

    "responses": "Mental illnesses are health conditions that disrupt a personâ€™s thoughts, emotions, relationships, and daily functioning. They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life.\nMental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital.\nIt is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a personâ€™s character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brainâ€™s biology.\nSimilarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful."

    "responses": "It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background.\nAlthough mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficit\/hyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children.\nAdditionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition.\nParents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their childâ€™s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs)."

What about as each little subset or subnetwork of the brain shuts down? Pay attention closely and you can begin to identify those subnetworks. It's huuuugely fascinating stuff.\n\nI try to identify each portion (e.g. the sense of time, the sense of a separate self, pattern matching facilities, vision, hearing, sensory input, fear, sense of beauty, etc) as well as how they might fit together in a layered structure... and try to make mental notes of what drugs are showing which... so that combinations could potentially show me more.\n\nWhat makes it further challenging is that every body\/mind is different, so specifics can be less than a helpful path of guidance."

   "responses":[ "Most psychedelics will confront you with your fear of death, and the ways you're being lazy and not living your short life to its full potential. High doses are the most revealing, but you may need to start with low doses and build up to the breakthrough dose as you grow.\n\nDMT is incredible, and leaves you with more questions than answers. However, for making lasting changes in your consciousness and worldview, DMT is too short compared to other psychedelics which last longer and give you time to think and integrate the lessons.\n\nWhen you're ready to go all the way and experience rebirth and becoming infinity, 5-MeO-DMT is the final boss. It's called the God molecule for a reason. I look forward to trying it one day when I'm ready."

I want a total end to the war on drugs, all drugs legalized, and stores opening next month. That's not going to happen, though, so let's support what's pragmatic. I work mostly on the state and local level, but the federal level is important too. Right now we have cannabis banking legislation in Congress- to legalize cannabis businesses using banks- that might go through. That's a very important step. This amendment from AOC would be really important too. If it passes then people would be allowed to ask for government money and approval to research psychedelics. \n\nMAPS is already researching psychedelics. Anyone new to this, check out maps.org; it's an excellent site. But every single dollar they raise has to come from private sources. In a tight economy like this- that's difficult. We should be getting public funding for psychedelic research. If we have countless billions of dollars to waste on the DEA and the military-industrial complex, then we have money for funding important science; it's just a matter of priorities.

Down in dreams usually means negative, as opposed to raising up, more positive. Then there are cultural symbols, those of your country or ethnic group. The same dream would be interpreted differently in one part of the country than another. Then there are personal symbols, those of you or your family, a certain dream would be seen differently, because of your upbringing, and the life you have lived yourself. What one person views positively, might be viewed as negative in your life. You can buy books on dream interpretation, but these are usually universal things, but it's a start place. \n\nThere is also meditation, it allows you a glimpse into your, subconscious, and unconscious minds.

A terrible sense of dread and doom filled me - I knew what washappening, I knew I couldn't stop it, but it was so devastating; I was being destroyed - allthat was familiar, all reference points, all identity - all viciously shattered in a few seconds. Icouldn't even mourn the loss - there was no one left to do the mourning.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) medical procedure. ECT is typically administered under general anesthesia, so you will not feel any pain during the procedure. During ECT, electrodes are placed on your head. The electric current is then passed through your brain for a few seconds. This causes a seizure, which typically lasts for about 30 seconds.ECT is thought to work by changing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain, such as serotonin and dopamine. These chemicals are thought to play a role in mood regulation.ECT is a very effective treatment for severe depression. In fact, it is one of the most effective treatments available for this condition. Studies have shown that ECT can be effective for up to 80% of people who have not responded to other treatments.ECT is a safe procedure when it is administered correctly by a trained professional. The most common side effects of ECT are short-lived and include headache, nausea, and memory problems.ECT is typically given as a series of treatments, usually 2-3 times per week for 2-4 weeks. The number of treatments needed will vary depending on the individual's responses to treatment.ECT is not a cure for depression, but it can be a life-saving treatment for people who have not responded to other treatments. If you are struggling with severe depression, talk to your doctor about whether ECT may be right for you."]

However my own experiences with therapeutic low doses has been very positive. You're welcome to try such an approach.  If you do I  really, really hope you have someone who can act as a compassionate sitter mindful of your needs. \n\n If there's anyone you can talk to about the way you're feeling, like a therapist, or perhaps counselling is available at your place of education, it'd be worth trying that path out as well. Antipsychotics are a mental health band-aid and even if they are helping you they're not going to heal you. And it may seem like work to begin with, but mindfulness meditation may help you to reduce your anxiety levels, and that would be something worth working towards. \n\nAnd to paraphrase what I said to the other person, something you need to know even if I can't prove it at just this moment is: you matter, you are loved, and you don't need to be afraid."

"responses":[ "About a month ago, my buddy and I each took 50mg of that stuff, in combination with peganum harmala (Syrian Rue) for the MAOI effect (essentially making it an ayahuasca-like combo that people call \"psilohuasca\"). And HOLY SHIT it was one of the most intense and bizarre experiences I've ever had in my life. Complete ego dissolution. I forgot my entire life and identity, piece by piece. At one point, I couldn't really remember where I was or what I was doing. I was straining to get a grip on the current situation. I had vague memories of having taken some kind of drug, but it seemed like that was years in the past, or even in some other lifetime. Very hard to describe, the way my entire personal history and identity began to blur and slip away from me. At first it was kinda scary... I remember curling up in the fetal position and whimpering and trying really hard to control my breathing. But then the ego death went even further, so that even the part of me that felt fear was ripped away. That was the last layer of my ego. After that point, I was nothing but pure consciousness being conscious of itself. No fear or discomfort whatsoever. Just basking in the eternal, crystal-clear light of pure being. At one point I think I was speaking in tongues or something. I was jabbering, free-associated words and warped syntax just flowing out of me, for what seemed like an hour straight, at least. And I have no clue what I was even saying. Really wish I would have recorded audio of that part.\n\nAs for the visuals, they were utterly mind-blowing, of course. Closed-eye visuals were impossibly complex sentient geometries of infinite combinations and colors, folding into and out of themselves, collapsing, reforming, sometimes taking the shape of animals or monstrous faces. Self-perpetuating fountainheads of pure potentiality. And the open-eye visuals were very strange. I kept feeling like I was seeing \"the simulation\" that everyone always talks about. I was seeing glitches in the fabric of the simulation. The very fabric of reality looked like it was made out of iridescent digital fluid of some kind. Everything was glowing and shiny and quivering with so much vibrant, intense lifeforce. Very twitchy and glitchy and almost pixelated, but also very flowing and liquid-like. My hands turned into these crazy silvery, translucent alien hands. Fingers seemed elongated. Felt like I was really seeing my body for the first time. I had the distinct feeling that consciousness was \"base reality\"], and somehow consciousness had created the simulation that we call the physical world. This \"simulation\" is some kind of super complex, highly-developed technology, beyond anything that we can possibly imagine. Or maybe consciousness itself is the \"technology\"? I don't even know.

"patterns":["About a month ago, my buddy and I each took 50mg of that stuff, in combination with peganum harmala (Syrian Rue) for the MAOI effect (essentially making it an ayahuasca-like combo that people call \"psilohuasca\"). And HOLY SHIT it was one of the most intense and bizarre experiences I've ever had in my life. Complete ego dissolution. I forgot my entire life and identity, piece by piece. At one point, I couldn't really remember where I was or what I was doing. I was straining to get a grip on the current situation. I had vague memories of having taken some kind of drug, but it seemed like that was years in the past, or even in some other lifetime. Very hard to describe, the way my entire personal history and identity began to blur and slip away from me. At first it was kinda scary... I remember curling up in the fetal position and whimpering and trying really hard to control my breathing. But then the ego death went even further, so that even the part of me that felt fear was ripped away. That was the last layer of my ego. After that point, I was nothing but pure consciousness being conscious of itself. No fear or discomfort whatsoever. Just basking in the eternal, crystal-clear light of pure being. At one point I think I was speaking in tongues or something. I was jabbering, free-associated words and warped syntax just flowing out of me, for what seemed like an hour straight, at least. And I have no clue what I was even saying. Really wish I would have recorded audio of that part.\n\nAs for the visuals, they were utterly mind-blowing, of course. Closed-eye visuals were impossibly complex sentient geometries of infinite combinations and colors, folding into and out of themselves, collapsing, reforming, sometimes taking the shape of animals or monstrous faces. Self-perpetuating fountainheads of pure potentiality. And the open-eye visuals were very strange. I kept feeling like I was seeing \"the simulation\" that everyone always talks about. I was seeing glitches in the fabric of the simulation. The very fabric of reality looked like it was made out of iridescent digital fluid of some kind. Everything was glowing and shiny and quivering with so much vibrant, intense lifeforce. Very twitchy and glitchy and almost pixelated, but also very flowing and liquid-like. My hands turned into these crazy silvery, translucent alien hands. Fingers seemed elongated. Felt like I was really seeing my body for the first time. I had the distinct feeling that consciousness was \"base reality\"], and somehow consciousness had created the simulation that we call the physical world. This \"simulation\" is some kind of super complex, highly-developed technology, beyond anything that we can possibly imagine. Or maybe consciousness itself is the \"technology\"? I don't even know. But the whole trip had a powerful sense of seeing behind the veil. After we came down, I told my buddy that I had just seen the simulation coming apart at the seams.

I've tripped more times than I can count on very high shroom dosage (I only like natural shit). Anyways, I can help you compute it a little bit. Psychedelics work by allowing every part of your brain to communicate with every other part, which allows you to literally see and analyze your subconscious, the fabric of your own being. Some classic and easy to spot examples of this are tracers, robotic sounds, or objects looking like they are breathing. The robotic voices, visual tracers, and all other visual hallucinations are a sort of feedback loop in your brain where the information is circulated around your brain where every part of you brain alters it and sends it back around again. For instance objects breathing happens when your eyes talk to your medulla, the part of your brain responsible for subconscious body functions like breathing. In essence it is a lot like how a mirror allows you to keep hygiene in your body by reflecting on your physical appearance, psychedelics are like a mirror for your soul. What you see and feel are reflections of who you are at the deepest levels of your mind.  A healthy human mind has good and evil deep down, and they key to a productive psychedelics trip is to search for that good in your very soul. It will appear as a blinding light, warming you under your skin like a sun in your soul. Much like a sun you can only glance for a second, but this is the visual manifest of the potential within you. Once you see it is all you can do to strive to be your best self. This lesson does not have to be learned from psychedelics, and is often learned from physical and mental struggle. Why do you the US special forces has Hell weeks? Anyways that is my two cents on tripping in general, and I hope it wasn't too long winded. Thanks"

"responses":[ "Took my time to reply because.. Fuckk!! Got stoned and went ham reading\/learning from your post. Thank you so much. I am genuinely so grateful for all of your responses, you’ve introduced me to I feel and even larger universe of thoughts and realities. \n\nThe Chinese hells sound real af and the tea of forgetfulness makes perfect sense. Specially when even in r\/damokians he talks about his alien wife laughing when he asks if he’s going to go to hell and she just points down and mouths “lower”. And I have to admit I feel I definitely believe everything he experienced and wrote about. Trippy world is the real world. imo. I’ve never done DMT but now feel a stronger pull than ever to: I also remember the same feelings of enlightenment and eureka and wanting to bring it back (with shrooms and lsd) when the trip is done, and then it’s like you can feel it all slipping away when your coming back down but then your not even sure what it it is that is slipping away. Which I guess is the whole point, so you just shrug it off 🤷🏻‍♀️ and move on with earth life.\n\nThat last guy that ended up naked in the drunk tank. I also believe 100% what he experienced was real and the truth. I have so many times also come to the conclusion that I am the “original soul” , and honestly we probably all are. I know we are all the same soul, one soul. It could be that we ARE the original soul, the top consciousness of everything, of all the dimensions and realities, and that’s why they trapped us here, so we couldn’t be at the top of all the realms anymore. I wonder what we did? Sorry just thinking out loud. \n\nThe couple times I tried astral projecting on purpose I basically just tried to mediate. Im not very good but I try sometimes lol. Inclosed my eyes and tried to visualize and space and my mind full of stuff floating around, just masses not very detailed just stuff could be papers, photos colors whatever it doesn’t matter, just something to hold a place in the space. all this stuff is all my thoughts, language, memories, etc. Then I’d picture a black void in the center of it all. Anything that came near it would get consumed by it and become the blackness. My goal was to focus only on the black void. Anytime any thought would come   I’d let myself accept the thought for that split second and not try to ignore it because you can’t it already happed. I’d visualize it as a paper document\/any”stuff” floating to the center of my focus. ala the black voice because this is what I’m staring at mentally. the more second with my eyes closed that would pass the more thoughts at once would try to flood my focus. So I’d try to just focus deeper and deeper into the blackness. Almost like imagining I’m trying to swim into it head first but with that magnetic pull mental energy if you know what I’m talking about. . I do have synesthesia so visualization does come very naturally for me . I try this harder and harder, and harder until I’d start feeling the waves, then vibrate, etc.  I’ll tell you what i felt every time, like the process\/sensation of the slipping out of your body. The first time when it just happened to me. I was laying in bed about to go to sleep, super tired but just thinking. I was staring at the left ceiling corner and my walls were painted dark purple and I had a red night lamp on. So the lighting was pretty dark but I could still see everything just fine. I was in that almost sleep state when in my vision (I was so sleepy I wasn’t really looking or focused my eyes were just open and spaced out) I saw heat waves. Like when it’s super hot out and you look down a street and you see the heat waves in the air, completely invisible in color but obviously there. Well identical to those, then they start coming towards me in their natural wave like motion. When they are right about to touch my face I felt panic like I wanted to move but it’s like I was just observing from my head but wasn’t in control of my body? It was not even a split second of that panic stuck feeling though and the the waves came into me or through me I don’t know, they got me, and as that happened my entire body started to vibrate. Not shake like a panic attack like you phone vibrate mode but on a human and I could feel it so much like little needles but didn’t hurt just uncomfortable feelings. And so I’m feeling this needle and seeing my left arm laying on my bed vibrating. because one the waves got me and I started vibrating I wasn’t glued anymore i felt out of that sleepy state and i could move my focus. So I’m seeing this happening and then my arm starts look like it’s going forward and it felt like when you’re next to a big semi and they take off before you and it feels like your rolling back for a second. Then I’m focusing out for a higher angle from my right. It’s felt like my focus zoomed of from the angle of the top of my head on the top toward the back right. Then I could see my body laying on my bed from this angle. I was at the corner ceiling of my room diagonal to the right behind me (my bed was up against this wall). I had no body or anything I was just me my consciousness but I felt like I could feel. I remember on a different one I felt wind when I was flying. But anyway. Maybe like 1 entire minute of this and then me freaking out when I realized  wtf. I remember from that view up there thinking what the fuck am I possessed is this satan (my room was lighted red and this I pre any psychedelics) I was young. So I slipped back? In one second I suddenly went from that view of me to me opening my eyes and I was in bed in the exact same position I had been in. But what freaked me out was that i opened my eyes because i remember I had never closed them. I remember I was staring off and the waves came. And to be honest idk if that is even astral projecting, but for me every single time I slipped out it happened this way.  This was all hella years ago for me. I remember trying a year or so back and nothing came of it. \n\nAnd for real thanks for that r\/damokians I’m still reading it. Post by post anytime I have time. Again also why I haven’t replied haha. Good luck with the astral projecting!"

Liars, cheats, and the likes are more concerned with themselves and not other people, so they’re chasing material goods. They’re dead inside, I wouldn’t say they have a good lot in life haha, but I definitely get what you are saying. \n\nI think hallucinogens really can teach you to be more self respecting, but that’s a whole mountain you’re still going to have to climb after trying psychs.\n\nFor real though, fuck the serpents in the garden lol. I like to stay positive with my worldview because I know there are really good people out there. Lately though, I have been observing a lot of people In my own generation acting narcissistic as all hell. It’s sad that so many people give in to the popular offerings of mainstream poisoned propaganda, although once you’re privy to what’s going on it’s your job to spread the awareness to your peers. \n\nYou definitely have to help yourself before you help others though. You gotta prepare yourself first before you enter the battle lol."

Why how and who? Lets put our creative effort into finding that. Could it be that people travelled sooner than we thought? Maybe, maybe it's only a few hundreds years old and some dude had a good boat and lots of money. I don't know but from that, to Atlantis is real.

The basic premise of this Chinese mythological figure suits the situation I posted about in a way regarding the forgetfulness I feel after a trip where I felt I remembered something ingrained in myself. What speaks to me mostly about this is the aspect where the drink is given to the soul so one experience doesn't interfere with the other. Symbolically the revelations or remembrance one has during a trip is forgotten upon arrival into a sober consciousness as to not interfere with the affairs of this reality."

I've quite literally been transported to another dimension that didn't fade even a little when I opened my eyes. You're there and there's nothing you can do but enjoy it until it's over (as long as you enjoy that kind of thing). DMT is much shorter of a time and I would suggest that before changa on acid. I would also suggest DMT alone before changa alone. It will do you good to feel out the realms of DMT while in its pure form which is much shorter acting than changa."

If you concentrate on that emotion with your eyes closed, it'll summon mental images from your personal experience that resonate with that emotion. And if you keep concentrating, and the dose is high enough, those personal images will soon shade into the transpersonal, allowing access to what might best be described as archetypal energy. There will be a distinct shift in your visionary space (i.e., you'll start seeing all manner of occult symbols and mythic figures), and likely a very strong surge of somatic energy. You can effectively become possessed by the archetype in the manner a practitioner of voodoo can be possessed by *loa*.\n\nIf you order these emotional states according to the template of the Hero's Journey, it can pretty reliably produce a spectacular, up-close-and-personal encounter with the Divine. When that happens, there's a phase transition. You exit *maya* and enter beliefspace. Ontological revelation and visionary downloads often result.\n\nGetting into these states reliably is a matter of skill. Here's how I'm going about cultivating it, step-by-step.\n\n1. Start with a minimal effective dose. Over the course of months of practice, add small increments. Do not jump into the deep end of the pool.\n2. But once you're there, get comfortable with large doses of the *substantia*. Depending on what you're going for, you can utilize endless combinations of mushrooms, Syrian rue, DMT, pot, and *rapé* . Those are my go-to's; ayahuasca is its own thing, and I don't trust substances I can't weigh out to the 1\/100th of a gram.\n3. The goal is to remain perfectly lucid no matter how strong the dose. Ego death, I'm convinced, is a necessary step, but it doesn't stop there. Eventually you should be able to get into states where the world has disappeared, but you can still recite name, rank, and serial number. You should always know where you are, what you're doing, and why.\n4. Once you've gotten that point...that's when things start to get interesting.\n5. You can start imposing cognitively complex and emotionally challenging tasks on yourself while you're deep in it.\n6. The psychological work I describe above is the start. Getting high and exultant is one thing; digging deep into one's Shadow, or manifesting Satanic rage, or exploring the collective human experience of heartbreak or imaginatively exploring what it means to be a black woman loving someone in a racist country...that's the advanced stuff.\n7. Once you can do that, you can take it even further by, say, doing it in front of an audience. Sing, dance, change costumes, tell stories, run a light show, hold space, all while under the influence of a superheroic dose.\n8. The measures of progress are the dosages you're able to tolerate, your ability to stay lucid, and, of course, the depth of your subjective experience.\n\nAmong all kinds of intangible benefits, it seems to create a tremendous amount of self-control that might, with practice, yield a practical definition of enlightenment, which is to say, flow-state executive function while dealing with all the vicissitudes of every day life.\n\nI call the practice \"Phonomancy.\"  It's kind of like psychic CrossFit.

Originally (and even today) formal experimentation with psilocybin more often than not involved synthetic psilocybin. Widespread shroom growing really only took off after the 70's, and Terence and Dennis McKenna played a key role in that.

Although I’m a sporadic meditator because of the amount of work I have been having to do lately (that’s probably a sign I need meditation even more than before), I’ve been using this app called Calm which has guided meditations. Have you tried using those before? They have excellent programs designed to target specific concerns, and I use one designed to calm anxiety. It’s a wonderful tool that I’m grateful to have discovered. You do have to pay for a subscription, but even after a few sessions I’ve noticed that I can keep my emotions (and therefore my physical sensations like chills and tremors) under control when I previously couldn’t, and I am more than happy to pay for that relief. \n\nAlso, have you tried journaling? Journaling before meditating helps me clear my mind a little and helps sort my emotions and helps me set an intention for my meditation. I know it sounds cheesy, but journaling has been an essential part of my journey to feel happier because I can see patterns in my life and reason with myself on why they’re good or bad. Try it out if you haven’t already!"

"responses":[ "Interesting, and I've never had the experience be as strong as what you describe. I guess we all feel it at some point, where you feel pretty sensitive to normal inputs. But it sounds like you've got it bad. I wonder if it's really a sensitivty or subconscious effect, or it's an effect of you being aware of it (and that's what's amplifying it).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, normally, I'd advise some mindfulness practice to get you settled, but you're already familiar, and I'm guessing you've already tried some techniques. So, if I were to say, \"when your mind is screaming, listen to your big toe instead\" might not be that helpful. What does occur to me is that there is such a thing as sensory saturation. That's the idea that if you expose yourself to the same sensation over time, your brain gets tired of paying attention to it, and more or less stops. So, this might seem weird, and I'm not going to guarantee any results, but let me suggest something: as a means of giving your brain a way out of this, try to overload it with other sensory experiences. Eat something really spicy. Slap your calves really hard (open palm - don't hurt yourself, just generate some sting) - those sorts of things. Make them pleasurable if you can. But intense. And focus on them. Try to turn your mindful brain onto these experiences, and drink them in. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOtherwise, I've got to think it's a temporary situation, and could be improved with a mild depressant, like a couple beers. Good luck with this. If nothing else, learn to appreciate it as a weird part of your continued weird existence on this planet. "

I wrote a gratitude journal of 10 things I was grateful for. I stocked up on healthy beverages and snacks in my fridge, so I wouldn't leave for the store. I added more sober activities to my life instead of drinking, such as hiking, walking, yoga. I de-cluttered my house and donated it all to charity each week for 6 straight weeks. I learned to code for free. So, adding one healthy habit rather led to another, then another, then another. By adding all these positive healthy habits, trying to be engaged, and live in the moment. That is what helped me overcome it. A few months into sobriety, I saw that my daily meditations were better than they have been in the past 10 years. Like something clicked over. It wasn't just routine anymore, it was joyful and more productive. I feel less anxiety overall, I feel present and happy."

"responses":[ "Medical student here.\nIBS and anxiety are known to be super linked. One hypothesis for why they are linked is that anxiety increases hypervigilance toward threat-related signals, both externally and internally - including uncomfortable bowel sensations, and this state of hyperreactivity toward ones’ own body precipitates episodes of increasing stress that set off pain\/diarrhea\/constipation. It’s thought that most people with IBS have a greater connection between their central and enteric nervous system. \n\nThis may also apply in IBD, but it’s quite different because it’s understood to be a major autoinflammatory disease leading to widespread inflammation that can range from the mouth to the anus(in crohn’s), whereas IBS is a ‘functional’(read- can’t be detected on c-scope or blood tests) disease. IBD usually requires pretty major treatment and even surgery when it flares. "

That's as far as you can go without using your mind to fabricate explanations. Anyone who has a \"better\" answer is just offering you their mind's fabrication and asking you to take it on faith.\n\n> how do I know what thoughts are true and whats false?\n\nWhat is a \"true\" thought? What is a \"false\" thought? Thoughts are thoughts. Are there \"true\" feelings and \"false\" feelings? Are there \"true\" sounds and \"false\" sounds? Some thoughts may be useful, some may not be. Generally, they're best treated as entertainment or theatre. You'll learn to recognize the gems and roll your eyes at the rest.\n\n> doesn't that make you avoid association with your feelings? I want to feel joy with being with my family or doing something I love, I want that to be a part of who i am, not just a random neuron firing that I shouldn't associate with and just treat like not good or bad.\n\nI think a better way to look at it is that you don't get too *attached* to feelings. For example, joy is great. Until it's gone. And when it is, even if things are just \"okay,\" you may actually feel bad because you observe the joy has been lost. Don't think about this as training to become dissociative. Think of it as training to appreciate the ephemeral nature of human experience. If you're having positive feelings, appreciate that you get to experience them (how precious!), and if you're having negative feelings, appreciate that it won't be this way forever (whew!).\n\n> If i try to reduce my anxeity, wont that reduce the good feelings on the other side of the spectrum aswell, since the same technique is used för both positive and negative feelings?\n\nNah. If you can learn to disembark the runaway train of anxiety (and other negative-valence patterns), you'll have more attention freed up to notice the positive characteristics in experience. Once the clouds start dissolving, the spacious, bright, clear nature of being aware really shines."

Anyone who has a \"better\" answer is just offering you their mind's fabrication and asking you to take it on faith.\n\n> how do I know what thoughts are true and whats false?\n\nWhat is a \"true\" thought? What is a \"false\" thought? Thoughts are thoughts. Are there \"true\" feelings and \"false\" feelings? Are there \"true\" sounds and \"false\" sounds? Some thoughts may be useful, some may not be. Generally, they're best treated as entertainment or theatre. You'll learn to recognize the gems and roll your eyes at the rest.\n\n> doesn't that make you avoid association with your feelings? I want to feel joy with being with my family or doing something I love, I want that to be a part of who i am, not just a random neuron firing that I shouldn't associate with and just treat like not good or bad.\n\nI think a better way to look at it is that you don't get too *attached* to feelings. For example, joy is great. Until it's gone. And when it is, even if things are just \"okay,\" you may actually feel bad because you observe the joy has been lost. Don't think about this as training to become dissociative. Think of it as training to appreciate the ephemeral nature of human experience. If you're having positive feelings, appreciate that you get to experience them (how precious!), and if you're having negative feelings, appreciate that it won't be this way forever (whew!).\n\n> If i try to reduce my anxeity, wont that reduce the good feelings on the other side of the spectrum aswell, since the same technique is used för both positive and negative feelings?\n\nNah. If you can learn to disembark the runaway train of anxiety (and other negative-valence patterns), you'll have more attention freed up to notice the positive characteristics in experience. Once the clouds start dissolving, the spacious, bright, clear nature of being aware really shines."],

This gentle approach to yourself in meditation is called maitri. This is translated as “lovingkindness,” or just “love.” In terms of meditation, we learn to be kind, loving, and compassionate toward ourselves.\n\nI teach about maitri a lot, and it is often misunderstood as some kind of self-indulgence, as if it is just about feeling good and being self-concerned. People will often think that that’s what I mean by maitri. But it’s somewhat subtle what maitri is and what it isn’t. For example, you might say that taking a bubble bath or getting a workout at the gym is maitri. But on the other hand, maybe it isn’t, because maybe it’s some kind of avoidance; maybe you are working out to punish yourself. On the other hand, maybe going to the gym is just what you need to relax enough to go on with your life with some kind of lightheartedness. Or it might be one of your 65 daily tactics to avoid reality. You’re the only one who knows.\n\nSo it’s important to be clear about what maitri means and not to come away with a misunderstanding of maitri as some kind of indulgence, which actually weakens us and makes us less able to keep our heart and mind open to ourselves and the difficulties of our life. I often use this definition: maitri strengthens us. One of the qualities of maitri is steadfastness, and that’s developed through meditation. So through boredom, through aches, through indigestion, through all kinds of disturbing memories, to edgy energy, to peaceful meditation, to sleepiness, it’s steadfastness. You sit with yourself, you move closer to yourself, no matter what’s going on. You don’t try to get rid of anything—you can still be sad or frustrated or angry. You recognize your humanity and the wide gamut of emotions you might be feeling.\n\nWhen we cultivate maitri toward ourselves, we are also generating equanimity. Equanimity means we are able to be with ourselves and our world without getting caught in “for” and “against,” without judging things as “right” or “wrong,” without getting caught up in opinions and beliefs and solidly held views about ourselves and our world. Unconditional friendliness is training in being able to settle down with ourselves, just as we are, without labeling our experience as “good” or “bad.” We don’t need to become too dramatic or despairing about what we see in ourselves.\"\n\nhttps:\/\/tricycle.org\/trikedaily\/pema-chodron-maitri\/"

When asked why he'd brought such an irritating person serving an unnecessary role for a journey like this, it was explained that this persona was Padmasambhava's teacher of patience and compassion. If he lost compassion for this tea maker, how could he have compassion for others he has yet to meet who will be stuck in their own attachments and ignorances?\n\nNot saying that needs to be your or any of us. It's an ideal to aspire to. Padmasambhava is said to be a kind of second Buddha because of how wise and kind he was. The story's purpose is to show that difficult people offer us unique opportunities to practice virtuous actions which, from what I've read, you are already well into. I thought you might like this story because it reminded me of yours. You're living with such a tea maker!\n\nBut you're not Padmasambhava and you have your own life to live.

These teens talk about feeling a bit left out in comparison to their peers who have smart phones, but they also didn’t have to deal with the same kind of cravings that teens with phones have.\n\nIn my opinion, and I’m only speaking for myself and what I’ve seen, young people experience the same kinds of cravings for the dopamine rushes their phones can give them as adults. Our phones give us a kind of high that comes from having likes or retweets on social media, receiving text messages, and so forth. My concern is apparent is that there are companies out there literally designing apps to capture our attention and hold it for as long as possible. When it comes to younger minds that are still developing, this really worries me."

Don't take them personally; use your chance to watch them and understand more about them.\n\nHere is a silly analogy. A monster lives in your room and scares you while you are asleep. Every time it jumps out you scream and fear the monster more and more. It torments you. Eventually, you take a new approach.

I believe meditation can help you practise 'being' - and being comfortable with you, without self-criticism, and self-hate. Through practising being present with you, you learn that you're enough already. And then you have the strength to see that you don't need to rely on crutches to get through the day.\nHow to convince someone else of this, I have no idea. I also have parents I'd like to help, but I'm not sure how to approach it with them. But I do know that the decision to change needs to come from within them. Nothing you ever say or do will inspire them to work through their cravings, withdrawls and low moments. It needs to come from the strength they find in them."

We are washing the dishes, but then a thought comes up. You can choose to come back to the dishes, or you can choose to engage in the thought. They key concept is that it’s your choice. \n\nWhen you aren’t mindful, you aren’t fully aware of the dishes, you aren’t fully aware of the thoughts. You aren’t paying attention, you’re just lost in it. The thoughts are running free and you get so deep in them you forget that there’s anything outside of thinking.\n\nMindfulness is paying attention. Ideally you’re fully engaged in what you’re doing, but there will always be distractions, thoughts will always chime in. They aren’t bad, it’s just your thinking mind doing what it does. You can use that thought to be productive or imaginative, or you can choose to come back to the activity you’re doing. The idea of mindfulness is that you have that choice, the true you, the silent intelligence that’s running the show, decides if it wants to engage in thought or if your awareness would be better spent elsewhere."],

Sometimes you have to talk on the phone while you’re cooking, or you have to change the radio dial as you’re driving. So do allow yourself to live as a functioning human, then come back. If you can keep some awareness on the silent awareness in the background the whole time, you can stay mindful even in the chaos.\n\nThe thing to watch out for is the “I can’t wait til lunch” then lunch comes around and already it’s “I can’t wait til work is over” then work is over and “I can’t wait til dinner”. “I can’t wait til the weekend”.

"responses":[ "I 100% agree with you. There's a scary number of meditation practitioners or so-called mindfulness practitioners out there doing it just to get ahead or feel good: productivity, efficiency, \"success\"], \"happiness\". In the end that's not what it's all about. Mindfulness is learning to be with the highs and the lows of life and as such we must practise on and off the cushion paying attention, moment to moment, without judgment, because we don't have anywhere near as much control as we think we do about our internal and external experience. When I first started practising mindfulness I spent a lot of time judging myself for not being able to control my stress levels and my ability to focus. Eventually I realised that the results only come when we stop striving and just let things happen naturally. After many years of formal and informal mindfulness practice,  I still don't have a stress-free life or super-human ability to control my attention, but things do feel generally more peaceful and I'm a lot better at managing distractions than before. I think this is largely down to a change in the way that I talk to myself. I no longer judge myself for not being perfect and whatever thought or emotion comes up, I am better able to look at it through a lense of kindness and curiosity rather than reactivity. So in short, your attitude (or rather intention) to the practice matters one hell of a lot! "

"responses":[ "Yes I do metta. I like to think about it this way: when sending love to another being, if that love meets pain, then compassion arises. Metta is underneath both love and compassion.\n\nI do metta in two main ways. First, via phrases, where I recite a series of phrases as I think about or visualize a series of people. For example, thinking about someone I love, I may say to myself “may you be happy.” I start with beings for whom the metta flows easily, and end with beings who are neutral or difficult. In the middle I include myself.\n\nThe other way I practice metta is “radiating metta,” where I cultivate a metta feeling or energy and radiate it in all directions, to all beings.\n\nThere are probably other ways to practice metta and compassion. I hope this is helpful!"

There are lots of ideas online that give you prompts to get started. You could start by doing a summary and then talk about any parts of the day that may have affected you negatively and how you could respond or react more positively in future as well as pointing out good parts of the day; the times you felt mindful of things that went well. You could also end it by listing 3 things you are grateful for that day or 3 goals for the next day, etc. It really is entirely up to you and what you feel works best, but give different methods a try until you find the right fit for you - there is no right or wrong. The only thing I would advise is to try and avoid making it a place for only negativity. While it can be a good way to release any stress or anger about a situation, you also still want it to be a source of reflection and gratitude for improving your overall mindset. Hope that helps!"

"responses":[ "Sure. First, I had to recognize that this generation of games, phones, computers, apps, etc. is not like the previous generation. It would take me a while to describe precisely how this is happening, so instead I'll just point you in the right direction by recommending that you research terms like: the attention economy, Adam Alter, Tristan Harris, Chamath Palihapitiya, and phone addiction by design. It might sound \"woo-woo\" at first, I know, but trust me this is a real issue.\n\nOnce I learned how this was being carried out, I experimented with various techniques to help me manage my technology usage habits. One of those techniques was general mindfulness. I took it upon myself to be mindful of how I was feeling and what I was thinking about before and during technology use. Eventually, I realized that a lot of my usage was mindless escapism from uncomfortable emotions like anxiety and boredom. When I took the tech away, I was forced to experience these emotions and thoughts head on which is kind of like what happens when you meditate.\n\nIn addition to this, practicing purposeful and mindful technology usage led me to be less swayed by Fear Of Missing Out (FOMO) and other things. It forces you to let go of things you can't control. Once again, this is a similar to what one experiences when they meditate in general.\n\nOddly, I find it much easier to meditate now that I've changed my technology habits. I think this goes to show that it's affected me positively in that area of life."

"patterns":["A comprehensive meta-analysis of mindfulness research suggests that increased mindfulness is associated with increased prosocial behavior, both in correlational and in intervention studies."],
"responses":[ "I thought that people here will find this interesting.\n\nAbstract\n\n> Mindfulness‐based meditation practices have received substantial scientific attention in recent years. Mindfulness has been shown to bring many psychological benefits to the individual, but much less is known about whether these benefits extend to others. This meta‐analysis reviewed the link between mindfulness – as both a personality variable and an intervention – and prosocial behaviour. A literature search produced 31 eligible studies (N = 17,241) and 73 effect sizes. Meta‐analyses were conducted using mixed‐effects structural equation models to examine pooled effects and potential moderators of these effects. We found a positive pooled effect between mindfulness and prosocial behaviour for both correlational (d = .73 CI 95% [0.51 to 0.96]) and intervention studies (d = .51 CI 95% [0.37 to 0.66]). For the latter, medium‐sized effects were obtained across varying meditation types and intensities, and across gender and age categories. Preliminary evidence is presented regarding potential mediators of these effects. Although we found that mindfulness is positively related to prosociality, further research is needed to examine the mediators of this link and the contexts in which it is most pronounced.\n\nConclusions\n\n> We found converging, multimethod evidence for theoretical claims that mindfulness increases the incidence of prosocial acts toward others, with medium‐sized pooled effects for both correlational and intervention studies. Interventions that trained mindfulness as their sole focus had similar‐sized effects on prosocial responding as those that combined mindfulness with prosocial emotions, suggesting that non‐judgemental awareness alone fosters helping behaviour to a similar degree as compassion‐oriented meditation. Evidence to‐date suggests that these effects may occur via greater empathic concern, emotion regulation and positive affect. Lastly, we found that mindfulness interventions had similar‐sized effects on prosociality towards known and unknown others, inline with an emerging body evidence that mindfulness mediation reduces intergroup biases. The results of the present review suggest that mindfulness fosters ethical and cooperative behaviour across a range of interpersonal contexts."

When this fight or flight system is on board, it narrows the mind to be focused on potential threats and responding to them.

"responses":[ "It's very common when a mediator starts developing some proficiency, although not everyone gets these kind of visuals. Some people might take this to be an indicator that you could be getting closer to \"access concentration.\" As you continue building the \"meditation muscle,\" you may start to see the field of darkness behind your eyelids (or field of darkness around your purple blob) start to grow brighter or \"warmer\" too.\n\nFor example, if you close your eyes in a dark room, it's very dark behind your eyelids. Most people would say it's \"black.\" But if you close your eyes on a sunny summer day, it will appear \"less dark\" or \"brighter\" behind your eyelids—perhaps more of a warm red or golden color. As your ability to focus and direct attention increases, you may experience a similar phenomena—the darkness may lighten or become a foggy red, golden, or whitish. Again, this doesn't happen for everyone though, so no one should take the absence of such to mean anything.\n\nSome traditions (e.g. see \/r\/TheMindIlluminated\/) would describe this as a phenomenological byproduct of \"unification of mind.\" Think of it as a sign that the various constituents of your mind are aligning with or unifying around the intent to pay attention to your experience. In other words, the ability of your mind to \"concentrate\" is improving.\n\nAs for what to do, just keep doing what you're doing, and stay curious (more with the qualities of your experience and less with the conceptual modeling behind what's happening, though).

"responses":[ "The way you naturally act tomorrow is based on today’s habits. \n\nThe more time spent meditating and being mindful naturally helps you spend more time in that state.\n\nAnd also, like all mindfulness, it helps you learn to reduce things that take you in the opposite direction, like eating or sleeping too much or too little, and reducing reliance on caffeine, refined sugars and alcohol.\n\nBeing aware that food, thoughts and activities influence the state of mind, just like slowing the breath slows thoughts and staring at a fixed point reduces stimulation.\n\nIn yoga, evening is for winding down, they recommend limiting violent movies and videogames as they disturb the mind.

"responses":[ "As far as mindfulness meditation goes, ground zero is pretty much always a focus on regulating your breath. Focusing on inhale exhale and every time your mind trails off into a train of thought, returning to that breath. Finding that inhale exhale again and again. This mostly aims to bring you to the most present moment in your mind. Solid strong deep breaths can actually do wonders for your entire body as well aside from the mental focus aspect. It’s not so much that it will lead you to answers but it will put you in a state most open to finding them if that’s not too confusing. The mirror thing is just something that I’ve found helpful but it is in the same realm of mindfulness. It could be totally useless to someone different. It’s one example of how after you build stronger capabilities with breathing and balancing your mind, you can take it a step further in many different directions depending on what your spiritual growth calls for. For example, the mirror method. It helps me self appreciate and focus on my inner self and goals because I’m not very confident naturally and I tend to over think my relationships with other people too much rather than focus on self growth and let my relationships grow naturally. I’d definitely give mindful meditation another strong attempt if you haven’t taken that route but I also don’t want to seem persuasive in any way. It is a valuable tool, but only when you let go and trust it even when it doesn’t immediately feel like it’s “working” or “doing anything” for you. It is almost the furthest thing from instant gratification although the small increments of growth you see in your ability to practice can still feel rewarding. The real reward is the positive life, people, and environment that it helps you manifest into your reality over time. Feel free to PM if you want to talk more, my door is always open!"

"responses":[ "I also felt turning off the radio was necessary to drive mindfully. But it's actually very possible to be mindful while listing to music or a podcast, or watching a movie. Mindfulness is awareness of the contents of your mind, of the present moment, and if your mind is full of music or other people talking, so long as you stay mindful of that, you are good.\n\nHowever usually I find silence is more peaceful and pleasant. Although I'll still sometimes throw on music or podcasts. I can be mindful at that point still, or get \"sucked in\" by the media, where the real world drops away, it just depends.\n\nWatching a movie in a darkened theater is a good example. If you are mindfully watching the movie, you are hyper-aware it's just a movie, you can see the whole theater like the exit signs and the other rows. You are aware of person in front of you and next to you. Aware of how much popcorn and drink is left. If you aren't mindful you get \"sucked into the story\" and the real world drops away. I find that can be very pleasant and nice, I even prefer that a lot of the time, but it's not mindfulness.\n\nSome people get sucked in to movies much more easily than others, and these are the people who jump in horror movies. Because they are 100% in the story, they are the character that's getting scared. I tend to see jump scares as just something director did, and if done well I appreciate it, but I have no reason to be scared, it's just a movie and I'm fully aware it's just a movie.

The thoughts are present, but it is your choice to act on those thoughts or not. Usually the first responses to a thought is that of an emotional one. It is quick, it could even be called instinctual perhaps. The important part to remember is that you do NOT have to claim that thought. Simply because it crossed your mind does not mean you need to act upon it. Which is why I like that visual of the mountain and the clouds.

When we become exasperated by life we hold a narrative within our minds that life should be *one way* or *another* and then when others around us don’t meet that narrative we *judge* them and life itself. “Life should be X, Y and Z.” Which is false. “Why am I the one to get cancer?” “Why am I the one whose wife cheats on me?” “Why am I the one whose car dies today?” \n\nAnd the buddhist’s answer is “Why *not* me?” Things happen to those around you, do you think you are special or separate or above others? If cancer happens to people, expect it to happen to you. If you see someone whose car has broken down, expect it to happen to you. That’s *life*. The *ego* says “Why me????” The buddha says “Why *not* me?”\n\nThings happen in life.

There's many similarities and many differences. In the most general sense, they both have similar sensations of psychedelic effect because they both are serotonergic on various 5-HT receptors. One major difference about LSD is that its significantly more dopaminergic than mushrooms. These causes LSD to feel more \"party\" like and recreational.   \n\n\nAlot of people are turned off by the idea that LSD lasts so long, and may think that LSD is more intense. From the first onset of the high, to 100% baseline sober is about 12 hours. But LSD takes a little longer to kick in than mushrooms, produces only about 3 - 4 hours of prominent psychedelic effects that ebb and flow in waves. The remaining duration is just a very long comedown of feeling fascinated and over stimulated.   \n\n\nThe comeup on LSD is more easy going than mushrooms as it's more gradual and euphoric. LSD kicks in about 40 - 60 minutes after ingestion, and from there takes another 30 - 60 minutes to fully peak. Mushrooms can kick in as fast as 20 - 30 minutes after ingestion and peak very quickly with a tendency to cause alot of anxiety.   \n\n\nAlthough both LSD and shrooms are stimulating and cause insomnia, LSD feels more stimulating. Shrooms have a heavy more sedating body load. LSD visuals are mild compared to shrooms and seem fuzzier, blockier, and simpler. Make no mistake, high doses of LSD can cause intense visuals, although more delirious like than mushrooms. Mushroom visuals are more vivid, organic, complex and flowing. At higher doses, mushrooms take on very peculiar, DMT like visuals. Also in my own opinion, i feel like LSD makes me more impressionable and suggestive, while shrooms makes me feel confident inside and introspective.   \n\n\nShrooms are a much more serious and wholesome trip. LSD feels like a better time, but shrooms feel like a better trip."

After I dosed those boys up I knew we were fucked, because I was a daily edible guy and I had to get out of bed hours later because I wasn't even close to peaking and I was FUCKED UP.\n\nThose two went to a concert in Sydney the next day and 24hrs after I gave them the muffin, B (14 years since his last smoke) said \"This is finally how stoned I wanted to be last night\"\n\n24 hours later he was still in purgatory. He spent the night lying in the spare room, apparently felt like he was in a lead coffin staring up at the roof, and was seeing random animals.\n\nWe thought that was hilarious and we call it the Jumanji Trip.\n\nPoor bastard. He never touched them again. Scared the living hell out of him."],

"responses":[ "**5-MeO-DMT (\"The Power\")**\n\nIt is basically a pure ego-buster. It isn't \"recreational\" in any way, unless you go for very small dosages (<3mg vaped, <5mg insufflated). Ego Buster dosages are around 12-15mg vaped and 20-30mg insufflated (but as always can vary a bit from person to person). \n\nMedium range dosages are IMHO not recommended, as you will experience a tremendous body load (\"like an elephant sitting on your chest\") combined with getting at the edge of ego death, which can be a horrifying and traumatic experience.\n\nIt isn't visual at all  for me, probably unless you're a good CYP2D6 metabolizer (which converts 5-MeO-DMT into the very visual 5-HO-DMT=bufotenin).\n\n5-MeO-DMT on ego buster dosages should only be done with an experienced sitter, who knows what to expect (e.g. vomiting, heavy screaming, strong movements, ...). Never do 5-MeO-DMT alone, if there's anything hazardous nearby (cliff, heat source like fire or hot bong, water, traffic, glass, ...)\n\nIf you're an atheist, be prepared to not being it anymore afterwards...\n\n**DPT  (\"The Light\")**\n\nDPT gets often compared to DMT. That's true in so far, as it is also very visual and you can \"Breakthrough\" on it. But the headspace is IMHO very different from DMT. IMHO it is much more dissociative and can develop strong thought loops. DMT OTOH is IMHO much more clear minded.\n\nWhile DMT disconnects you from your body, DPT doesn't. It actually even enhances strongly any body perceptions, which is one reason why I think it is the best substance for sex (even better combined with Moxy). Getting tremors, as well as heavy sweating is normal on DPT.\n\nIf you see tremors as bad, this can very likely steer your trip into a bad direction or get you straight into panic mode. If not, then you will actually often experience the tremors as pure bodily ecstasy, like a continuous whole body orgasm.\n\nOral ROA is possible but usually very inefficient and strongly dependent on personal metabolism (e.g. MAO levels), so that needed oral dosages vary strongly from person to person.\nBoofing is another option (which works really nice), and is more effective as oral, but still highly dependent on personal metabolism (MAO enzymes).\n\nUsually it gets vaped as FB or insufflated. The burn isn't big when insufflated as HCl salt, and it also doesn't have a strong smell. But nevertheless I get nose bleeds and have blood in my snort for more than a week after insufflation. I read some other people also get this problem. Vaped as FB, it has a very special \"ugly\" taste. So I would recommend adding some menthol crystal while vaping and then using a tictac or something like that to get this taste out of your mouth ASAP.\n\nFor me the dosage window between the \"BT\" and getting \"into the light\" is very small (70-100mg vaped), so that I mostly end up \"in the light\". The real special thing about DPT is, that you never lose the connection to the body entirely, even when going very far.\nWhich again makes it IMHO ideal for sex. You both melt into one continuous orgasmic blob floating in the fractals and moving towards the light where there's the beginning and the end.\n\nAlso just from my experience regarding \"difficulty of experience\"], for others this may very well differ:\n\nIf you get into the light, I don't see a problem, on the contrary.\n\nBut if you get stuck below that and cannot accept your fears and darker parts, I could well think you can get PTSD.\n\nIMHO it's different in regarding to 5-MeO-DMT, as with 5-MeO it really just revolves about bare survival (accepting to die), whereas with DPT it is IMHO more about total acceptance of yourself (also your darker parts), but the letting go and die part is easier, because of the dissociative effects.\n\nDPT also quite consistently gets you \"into the light\"], whereas this is pretty difficult or rare on DMT. There you usually just end up with the typical Breakthrough.\n\n> In what aspects are they the same?\n\nBasically that in the end, they get you to the same place. But as DPT is quite dissociative you don't take as much back from there, as with 5-MeO-DMT, but it's easier to let go, IMHO. Otherwise they don't have much in common."

Just that energy doesnt shoot out from things or inhabit other atoms, unless smashed together. \n\nEnergy seems to actually work alot like quantum data ( at least according to recent theories) where the information or description of a subatomic structure (quark) is transferred instantly to another entangled quark without the need of movement from point a to point b. This is the idea that energy exists everywhere, can be anything, and is inherently an aspect of atomic structure.  \n\nWhat this all means to me (among a bunch of other things) is that yes our energy is constantly reincarnated, our atoms will be reused, smashed down from stars, and eventually scattered. And when the physical universe collapses all material will convert to energy and recycle. \n\nI also like your notion of only temporarily using atoms. If we are spiritual entities inhabiting physical bodies than it would be safe to say that \"we\" are not directly tied to individual atoms but universally inhabit all atomic structure. :) running out of battery I'll try and revisit this in a bit if there's anything I missed. :) great points from both of you!"

As if the present were this car — nice car by the way — and the past is the road\nwe’ve just gone over, and the future is the headlit road up ahead we haven’t yet gotten\nto, and time is the car’s forward movement, and the precise present is the car’s front\nbumper as it cuts through the fog of the future, so that it’s now and then a tiny bit later\na whole different now, etc. Except if time is really passing, how fast does it go? At what\nrate does the present change? See? Meaning if we use time to measure motion or\nrate — which we do, it’s the only way you can — 95 miles per hour, 70 heartbeats a\nminute, etc. — how are you supposed to measure the rate at which time moves? One\nsecond per second? It makes no sense. You can’t even talk about time flowing or moving without hitting up against paradox right away. So think for a second: What if\nthere’s really no movement at all? What if this is all unfolding in the one flash you call\nthe present, this first, infinitely tiny split-second of impact when the speeding car’s\nfront bumper’s just starting to touch the abutment, just before the bumper crumples\nand displaces the front end and you go violently forward and the steering column\ncomes back at your chest as if shot out of something enormous? Meaning that what if\nin fact this now is infinite and never really passes in the way your mind is supposedly\nwired to understand pass, so that not only your whole life but every single humanly\nconceivable way to describe and account for that life has time to flash like neon shaped\ninto those connected cursive letters that businesses’ signs and windows love so much\nto use through your mind all at once in the literally immeasurable instant between impact and death, just as you start forward to meet the wheel at a rate no belt ever made\ncould restrain — THE END."

"responses":[ "You can’t force the experience if you want a true lasting message. If they’re happy where they were and didn’t feel something needed to change then of course they won’t dive in that direction cause they are in the flow they need to be. Tripping for me was always a ton more fun in the beginning and it was really just a drug that did wonders as one at first. I was younger and had no real problems to worry about but the older I got the deeper and more real life has become which has made it hard for me to just trip and not worry about anything. Tripping itself for me has become to real at times so my breaks in-between are so much longer than ever before and that’s ok. I now see it more as a tool to be respected instead of just a party drug or whatever you’d like to call it but it should be used for whatever the user decides to use it for whether it be to dive in and explore the inner-verse and sort out some deep rooted problems or just taking it to see the pretty colors and waves that Are around cause you had some extra time.  There should be no association between a reason for taking the drug and an individual in general as a whole but individually it’s what you choose to make of it\n\nEdit: nothing wrong with setting up some thoughts to tackle on paper before hand but personally that’ll take you away from being in the moment and just experiencing. But since you trip alone I bet it helps with staying on track and not just fully letting go.  If you ever trip with some pals I suggest going with the flow and not trying to plan out what to think (other than setting up your area and jams for the ride)"

We know a lot about reality and the natural laws that govern it, but we don't know why reality exists in the first place. Who created reality? Is reality his\/her version that is being force fed to us? Nobody knows.\n\nThat realization is life-changing for me. I think taking a step back and looking at the larger perspective is necessary for everyone today, especially if we want to prevent a civilizational collapse."],

It's similar to how a dense forest of countless trees will blend into a single field of greenery from a far enough distance. This is obviously not a novel concept. Men far smarter than I have discussed it, but I'm nonetheless glad that I can experience it - however superficially.\n\nWhat you've said also reminds me of a teaching from classical Christian theism. It goes something like this:\n\n* A being comprised of parts can - theoretically - have its parts removed. At that point, these parts become external to the being.\n* Assuming that God is the origin of everything, it's illogical to conceive of something \"beyond\" or external to God.\n* If we posit that God is comprised of parts, then we allow for the possibility of these parts becoming external to Him.\n* Therefore, God cannot be comprised of parts. He must be \"divinely simple.\"\n* Following from this is the interesting idea that it is a technical mistake to speak of \"God's justice,\" \"God's mercy,\" \"God's intellect\" or any other such things. In God, these are not separable aspects, but are instead one thing."

You can’t really choose what thoughts come into your head, but you can choose which ones to pay attention to. What I believe psychedelics do is significantly alter our thought patterns so much so that can we forget who we are because our experience is being altered in such a drastic way. This can allow us to understand the greater truth which is that we are much more similar to projectors than we are to cameras. We project our interpretation onto reality rather than take reality in. This an understanding that truly has profound implications for how we live our lives. I had a lot of difficulty accepting this truth when using psychs which caused me to have some very difficult and confusing experiences. It can be a tough thing to grasp, but after coming to this realization with the help of a mentor it really changed my life for the better, and I realized how it applies everywhere, especially when tripping."

So, it worked.\n\nI would go again if I felt the need.  I wasnt fearful except for a moment and I had courage and the rest of the trip was positive.  I was at a point where I was experiencing without interpreting, which makes remembering difficult.  \n\nI'd like to start exploring more with cannabis and 4g dose on order that I might navigate that world with more mindfulness.  A higher dose was more like a magic carpet ride where I was holding on instead of exploring.  \n\nAlso those albino penis envy mushrooms are unforgiving.  Even microdosing them.  I recently had several other strains at a festival and I'm convinced of their potency and that there may be other alkaloids present or something as I get the weirdest body high.  I digress."

"patterns":["Passing through the White Portal"],
"responses":[ "Your post is confusing, because it asks three questions, and one of them is a non-sequitur.\n\n> Each time I felt or saw what could be described as a white portal to a new reality.  I have never been able to cross-over in fear of losing what I have in  this reality. This fear is what roots me to the world in which I live  in. What if this feeling is what people see when they die and is why  people describe the gates of heaven as white, just like what I have  seen? \n\nChristian mystics speak of the Divine Light; the Tibetan Book of the Dead describes the Clear White Light of the Buddha; Sufis the Noor-e-Ahadi, the Light of One. These are metaphors, but they are also literal descriptions. In visionary space the Absolute is often perceived as radiant white light. Why conflate what you see and what you're feeling? \n\n>Isn't everything chemical? The idea that feelings and memories are  derived from a chemical makes me value only what I can experience in  this present moment. \n\nIf you want to believe that consciousness is only an epiphenomenon of physical processes, far be it from me to convince you otherwise. All I'll say is, the experiences of many, many people dispute that assertion.\n\n> Has anyone else witnessed this progression to a different reality? \n\nI've seen similar things. In fact, I've had visions of the afterlife. Here's one. It came during an ayahuasca ceremony. \n\n*In this waking dream I saw a ramp leading up to portal. Beyond it I couldn’t see, but I could feel what was inside—it was an entrance to the endless, churning white ocean of fire that is the Absolute, the Ground of Being. Near the ramp were floating abstract representations of angels, with simple geometric shapes denoting heads, wings, bodies. It seemed they were on patrol, but I understood that they were not there to prevent entry; they were lifeguards. The ultimate Isness of the Ground was exerting a seemingly irresistible attractive force, like a black hole, but it the force wasn’t gravity, it was love. The intensity of its love drew everything toward it.* \n\n*Other, lower order angels would drift toward the ramp and then halt. Somehow, they were able to keep from being sucked inside. But this wasn’t without cost. As they hovered the sheer intensity of God’s love began to shred the fibers of their being. Their robes rippled violently as if buffeted by a raging wind, and the edges of their odd, geometric wings caught fire and dissolved. I could tell it was agony for them, but also that, like the superhero starships of my earlier vision, this unbearable effort was also ineffable ecstasy. They were literally being consumed by love. Maintaining their suffering separateness was also an act of love, the greatest testament of loving gratitude possible for the gift of existence.* \n\n*It took everything they had not to fall into that divine ocean. For some, the effort would be too much. The tractor beam of God’s love would overcome them and they would fall toward dissolution. But then the guardians of the gate, the highest angels of all, the oldest and most powerful, the only ones capable of being so close to God without surrendering their individual existence, would catch them and return them to a safe distance. No one, it seems, makes a final return to Source before it’s truly their time.* \n\nSo yeah, that happened. But I want to point out that there is a LOT to see between here and there. There are many, many levels of consciousness to explore before one passes into the Absolute. And there are plenty of ways to get to those places, too. Find a method that interests you and practice. With time you'll get over the fear and then your real adventures can start :)"

The sciences, each straining in its own direction, have hitherto harmed us little; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality, and of our frightful position therein, that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the deadly light into the peace and safety of a new dark age.”"],

It felt amazingly liberated and I encourage you to do the same. You don’t need it. Honestly. You really don’t.\n It doesn’t change anything. We are not saving the world by posting articles about things or getting into arguments on threads. \n It’s just another distraction.\n Its all lies. And counter lies. The discourse is rotten and has nothing to do with the real world anymore of direct experience.\n Facebook, social media, youtube are all energy traps that lowers your conscious awareness and shortcircuits your concentration span.\n It’s an addiction and I’d say most of us are addicted to it.\n I feel freer and more myself now, like I have taken some of my power back.\n All these shiny screens are just distractions from living in the ‘real’ world.\n Iboga told me that you know we can’t fight this horrible beast of a machine. It has all the power and by engaging it, we are just feeding it. Control systems exist for one reason and that is total control. Much like how coporations exist purely for profit. It’s not even a real thing, it’s an entity of sorts that’s taken a life of it’s own.\n There’s no point fighting this shit or wasting our time worrying about issues that are so immense that it makes us feel powerless and impotent. Just start on a local level. Sustainability is flawed because the system we seek to sustain is fundamentally rotten at it’s core. It has served it’s purpose but we are entering a new era now and we need to start looking for new alternatives, new ways of being and living, individually and socially that are healthier and more productive. \n So that’s what I’m going to be looking into. We have no choice. The old way no longer works. Hopefully we will be able to find a different way to be from the mainstream that is just so much better for you that everyone will slowly disengage from this horror show and be done with it. \n The machine’s power runs on the amount of energy we have invested in it.\n Disengage as much as possible from the current system as you can. \n Leave facebook. Cancel your netflix subscription. Game of Thrones is not real. \n Superheros are not going to leap out of the movie screens to come save us.\n It’s not working for a lot of people anymore and it’s not going to last much longer.\n When the shit goes down, the cities will be the first to cop it. It will be chaos and bedlam in there, so I suggest you contemplate on heading to live in regional areas.\n\n....."

"responses":[ "Editing to add answer the the actual question:\n\n>could you please elaborate more on the role of the clinical psychologist in medicine?\n\nShort version: pretty much every health condition affects or is affected by behavior. Psychologists are good at behavior.\n\nPersonally, my clinical practice (currently as a postdoctoral fellow) is in a sleep clinic, which in turn is housed within a Neurology department. My mentor and I practice [behavioral sleep medicine](https:\/\/behavioralsleep.org\/index.php\/sbsm\/about-bsm\/what-is-behavioral-sleep-medicine). Basically, we use our knowledge of how the brain regulates sleep and a lot of basic clinical psychology stuff to make recommendations for behavior changes that will help people with their sleep.\n\nCBT-I, a specialized form of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, is the best treatment for insomnia, better than medications, and with benefits documented to last 10 years after 4-8 weekly appointments. Many patients who do CBT-I can discontinue their sleep medications, which is a good thing because they are often controlled substances, which can have unpleasant side effects, and people can develop significant tolerance to these medications. People can regain control of their sleep and their doctors can stop feeling frustrated by the hassles of prescribing ineffective medications.\n\nMost of our patients are referred by the physicians in the clinic, but sometimes a patient will have their first new patient appointment with one of us rather than a physician. When necessary, we will encourage patients to be seen by a physician as well. If they don't have symptoms of sleep disorders that *require* medical intervention, and they are not interested in sleep medications, then we may see them independently. For the most part, treatment is multidisciplinary.\n\nA doctor saying \"no more pain meds\"], \"eat less and exercise more\"], \"stop smoking\"], \"stop drinking\"], and \"stop using drugs\" almost never leads a person to making any of those changes. Accordingly, psychology has a significant roles to play in chronic pain, weight loss, smoking cessation, alcohol and substance interventions, and pre-surgical evaluation for bariatric surgery, organ transplant, and many other surgeries. Bariatric surgery requires astounding changes in eating habits, and organ transplants require strict adherence to medication regimen to prevent rejection, so it's wise to consult experts in behavior change.\n\nNeuropsychologists, a specific specialty of clinical psychology, can do much finer-grained assessments of cognition, including memory and attention, than neurologists typically do, which can help track progression of dementia, for example. This can also include the Wada procedure, which is a procedure performed prior to surgery to remove part of the brain that is causing seizures: half the brain is anesthetized by an intervention radiologist, then the neuropsychologist tests memory and language, and then the procedure is repeated for the other half of the brain. Better to know ahead of time if that part of the brain you're going to remove is critical for language or memory, because you can't put it back.\n\nFor more clear-cut mental health issues, some psychological interventions have been demonstrated to be as effective as medication options, and sometimes they are helpful adjuncts to medication treatment, and sometimes they are more effective than medication treatments. Some psychological treatments have not been tested in high quality studies, and so I cannot recommend them in good conscience. The best psychological interventions are for anxiety disorders such as OCD, PTSD, panic disorder, and phobias. However, benzodiazepine medications will interfere with these treatments - this is one case where combination treatment is a bad idea.\n\nHere's some self-pasta of my rant that I've posted before in various subreddits.\n\nThe topic is prescribing privileges of psychologists.\n\n**It's not necessary**\n\n* At least two pathways already exist: becoming a PA or NP. I've known a couple psychologists who have become NP's as well. The more pragmatic effort to *help patients* would be directed at getting psychologists waivers for PA\/NP courses such as psychopathology.\n* The majority of antidepressant medications are prescribed by primary care physicians ([source](http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC3670434\/)). With more and more psychologists moving into integrated primary care settings, they can collaborate in medication management today.\n\n**The lobbying has been deceptive and ineffective**\n\n* APA has spent an exorbitant amount of money lobbying for RxP. Money that could have been spent lobbying for things that are already in psychology's scope of practice. APA could instead be lobbying for better reimbursement for psychologists (relative to master's level providers) or for more use of, and reimbursement for, psychological assessments. Or they could lobby for better reimbursement for empirically-supported therapies. Instead, APA is (poorly) lobbying for increased scope of practice, which would require additional training at significant cost to psychologists. APA would stand to benefit financially from accreditation fees for these programs.\n\n* To fund its lobbying efforts, APA levied a deceptive practice assessment fee. In fact, after a class action lawsuit, APA was ordered to repay **NINE MILLION DOLLARS** to its members ([source](https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/to-your-health\/wp\/2015\/05\/06\/american-psychological-association-will-repay-members-9-million-in-settlement\/?hpid=z11&tid=hpModule_9d3add6c-8a79-11e2-98d9-3012c1cd8d1e)).\n\n* After years of lobbying, APA has achieved very little. The latest \"triumph\" in Illinois was a gutted version of RxP. Prescribing psychologists there cannot prescribe to children, adolescents, adults over 65, pregnant women, people with intellectual or developmental disabilities, or people with serious medical conditions ([source](http:\/\/www.apa.org\/news\/press\/releases\/2014\/06\/prescribe-medications.aspx)). Prescribing controlled substances is limited to \"nonnarcotic Schedule III through V controlled substances\" ([source](http:\/\/www.ilga.gov\/legislation\/ilcs\/fulltext.asp?DocName=072005700K303.05)).\n\n**It will take away from psychological interventions**\n\n* Prescribing medication will *necessarily* decrease use of psychological interventions. Psychopharmacology coursework, continuing education (either additional required hours or fulfilling the same number of hours with pharmacology CE), calls to the pharmacy, monitoring efficacy and side effects, etc. all take time that has to come from somewhere.\n* Here's a quote (emphasis added) from a prescribing psychologist: \"the extensive time needed to develop the expertise to become a competent prescriber means **we lose the time becoming expert evidence-based psychotherapists**.\" ([source](http:\/\/www.abct.org\/docs\/PastIssue\/37n6.pdf), page 157)\n* The RxP movement is already preparing to move into pre-doctoral training. Regarding the Illinois RxP law, the APA itself said \"One notable provision is that the new law paves the way for psychology graduate students to begin studying clinical psychopharmacology at the predoctoral level, setting the stage for them to apply for prescriptive authority in Illinois once they complete their doctoral training and licensure.\" ([source](http:\/\/www.apa.org\/news\/press\/releases\/2014\/06\/prescribe-medications.aspx))\n* Psychiatrists used to provide both pharmacological and psychological treatments. Some still do, but they often need to be in private practice to do so.\n* Some say psychologists will be less prone toward polypharmacy than psychiatrists. Many psychiatrists already take a conservative approach toward psychopharmacology, and painting them as polypharmacists is fairly insulting. Psychiatrists, by and large, are 1) aware of the risks of polypharmacy, and 2) aware of the benefits of psychological interventions. It's a lack of good psychologists (or other therapists) providing quality treatments that's the problem. Psychiatrists know about the risks of medications, particularly medications like benzodiazepines, which really aren't appropriate for long term use. They often don't have a good alternative though. There are simply too few psychologists who are trained in empirically supported treatments for panic disorder, PTSD, OCD etc. Psychological treatments for those sort of problems - panic control treatment, prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy, and exposure and responses prevention, are the first line and best treatments for those disorders.

"responses":[ "I say this pretty much every day: arguably *the* central tenant of mindfulness is \"non-judgmental awareness.\" That being said, abandoning the judgment of your thoughts is central to this, and something we all have to work on.\n\nTo the OP, \/u\/frogkid2476, the goal of mindfulness is not \"to decrease the amount of uncomfortable feeling in my life\" but to be mindful.\n\nWhat you are struggling with is one of the hardest things to deal with and that is to attempt to be mindful without a goal in mind, other than to be mindful.\n\nThink of it this way, you want to win basketball games, so you need to improve your shooting. If, while you are trying to practice shooting the ball, your mind is actually on trying to win games, then you aren't going to be focusing on the right thing: honing your mechanics such that your shots are going to be more accurate. You should be focusing on the mechanics during that practice. The goal of practicing shooting should be to practice shooting. Nothing more, nothing less. This isn't a trick, just the best way to go about it. If you focus on your shooting baskets, the rest will start to fall into place.\n\nIf your goal is to judge feelings in order to get rid of the ones you label as \"bad,\" your goal is not one of mindfulness and you will continue to miss shots."

Take a shower, shave, brush your teeth, clip your nails. And straighten up whatever room you spend time in. \n\nDistract your brain with something tangible. Learn how to solve a Rubik’s cube or some yo-yo tricks. Get a jigsaw puzzle and put on some relaxing music. \n\nCome up with three gratitudes daily. They can be very simple. I’m grateful I’m not sick right now. I’m grateful for that breakfast burrito this morning. I’m grateful for Mystery Science Theater 3000. Exercise your ability to find the good in life and you will get stronger. \n\nDo some simple stretches or basic yoga - I like Yoga With Adrian on youtube. It’s impossible not to like her. \n\nStart tracking your anxiety. Keep a note of the date and what you’re feeling - If you managed to overcome it, record what you did that helped. You may notice a pattern. Observing yourself is important for developing the ability to step outside of your own thoughts and saying to yourself, “Look at you, having anxiety again. And right on schedule, too.”\n\nMost anxiety stems from either reliving past suffering or worrying about potential future suffering. Remember that the past is unchangeable and the future is unknowable. How much time have you wasted worrying about things that never happened? Now is all that exists. Focus on right now, and actively do something for your own mental health. \n\nOh, and put down your damn phone. \n\nBest wishes!"

"responses":[ "Of course, you are touching on what is up for discussion, which is awesome to me. No questions are absolutely simple nor absolutely complex (:.\n\n\"Wholesome thinking\" has many **meanings**. Thus, wholesomeness is subjective, as is all language. Even in mathematics, as far as probability space goes, all words and ideas are not law of nature and are subjective. Suppose a person that despises all social institutions. Such a person may identify with a meaning for the term \"wholesome.\" As example, the death of organized society may be wholesome to this person\/perspective. \n\nI also live on a subjective level. I am a social human being. I opt for wholesomeness as the accessibility of wisdom, love, and selflessness for all. This is ideal, but wholesomeness is a rather idealized word. Wholesomeness is a malleable idea. Any human may be capable of a more wise, more loving, more selfless idea of wholesomeness than the one I can offer now. However, for the \"individual\" (for lack of better words), adopting an **inclusive**, \"golden rule,\" idea of wholesomeness, and pursuing it, is a winning social strategy for humanity. I can talk more about this, but I wish to be concise (for this reply).\n\nStress is natural to humans. Meditation is more a medicine than a cure or a mystical power. That is, meditation allows for **mindfulness**, that is, attention to the mind's \"rolling\" as described above. \"Rolling\" is spontaneous, arising from what Buddhism and Zen call \"emptiness\" or not-self. Meditation's importance is subjective. What is necessary for those seeking a peaceful mind, as \"I\" have been, is to consider options. What are the options for thinking? Remember, thinking is an action, so in \"my\" opinion\/experience, loving, learning, and giving (all in adherence to each other really) are sufficient for recognizing worry, hatred, greed, and aversion, to then let these 'negative' thoughts go and to allow the mind and body to adjust. This is wordy, please excuse me. \n\nDrugs feel great. Our senses become distracted from pain. Our feelings become agreeable. This is the pitfall of drug use: being high makes things cool again, but what happens when I come down? Am I prepared to live if I can't get high tomorrow? I've only begun asking this to myself. \n\nThere is no goal. there is no end. Human existence is equivalent to that of a table or a ball of tin foil when it comes to reality, as consciousness is temporary and we become dust and indifferent to human perception. There is always dissatisfaction and pain. Overcoming suffering is the key to living free of suffering. This is achievable through mindfulness. Not \"meditation\" without mindfulness. \n\nMeditation without mindfulness yields no fruit. Mindfulness without **insight** yields no fruit. Meditation is not even the only way of being mindful, but it is a **skillful method** of being mindful, as clinging to concepts, sensations, and emotions is more easily released when none of these things are overwhelming in the now. Practice mindfulness and learn from insight, both external and internal insight. This will guide the way to emptiness, or awareness of not-self (do not use Google for this without Zen\/Buddhism, lots of loaded bullshit is out there). I hope this helps. I am a bit sluggish right now lol. Cheers."

"responses":[ "I guess it come down to what your actual reaction will be if you are directly confronted with a unfiltered view of reality through your practice. I don't want to encourage you to dread the \"dark night\"], you're absolutely correct that you might simply view it as novel curiosity.\n\nBut I think meditation clearly shows us that the ego wears lots of hats, and that there's nobody in absolute control. With that in mind, you may have a gut reaction from some part of your mind that you weren't expecting. You may have a deep intellectual appreciation of the situation, but you don't really know how you'll behave in a given situation until you're immersed in it, as with any situation. That's all I'm saying really, I don't want to pretend to be an absolute authority. The cure I think, as always, is curiosity and equanimity without too much certainty.\n\nIf you have the time, I'd highly recommend checking out this video. It's long, but it will probably explain it a lot better than I can (from somebody who knows a lot more than I pretend to!): [https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2LYa1YCdZH8](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2LYa1YCdZH8)"

"responses":[ "So, the important part of meditation is not the part where you are focused on your breath and your mind is not wandering. The important part is the moment that you notice your mind wandering, acknowledge it, and redirect your attention to your breath. If that happens 1000x per hour, then you are getting to practice the important part of meditation 1000x more than someone whose mind didn't wander at all. \n\nAn important part of the redirecting is to first acknowledge the thought in a non-judgemental, accepting way. So instead of, goddammit another thought!!, it's, oh I notice that thought. It can be helpful to give it a label - thinking, judging, planning, worrying, reminiscing, etc. And then gently redirect your attention. \n\nSometimes you will just be frustrated and judgemental, and you may think, oh no I'm supposed to be non-judgemental and calm. You are actually supposed to be whatever way you are, so you can just notice these states of mind and accept them too - oh, I'm experiencing frustration right now. You don't have to like it, but do include it in your awareness and experience. \n\nWhen I have had so many thoughts one after another that it's like there's no space between them to focus on the breath, sometimes I just let go of trying to focus on the breath and instead watch my thoughts. It feels like taking a back seat to the whirlwind of my mind, a place where I can watch it but I don't need to be caught up in every little thing."

"responses":[ "TL;DR: Journaling about zone outs and emotional states, creative\/focus-driven hobbies, and good social interactions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI highly recommend journaling or keeping a diary. Whenever you blank, have panic to strike, or having anything outside the norm (good or bad) write about it. It'll help in trying to recognize and address any triggers. Plus it will help you to recognize which issues are more frequent or recurring versus ones you just happen to run across.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI also recommend having creative hobbies that require focus. Rumination in small doses can be healthy, but if you get caught in long cycles by it, it can be bad. Drawing, writing, origami, whatever you choose that works best for you. Many people I know pick things that are small and repetitive (my mom for instance crochets granny square blankets), just about anything will do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAbove all else, I recommend trying to fill time with good social interactions. As with anything else, you should only go as far as you can handle, but this is the biggest help I had (and still have) in dealing with any anxiety I have. Just having a moment to vent or break away from whatever I was thinking about that had me in a bad place.  \n\n\nI tend to use all three in a cycle when I fall out of what I think is a normal mindset. Journaling becomes my diagnostic, hobbies help me repair, socializing to hopefully maintain.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this helps!"

Now the question arises from your viewpoint - should we allow all itching and pain to rule us, or can we 'dull' them by not scratching, or taking an aspirin? In other words, do we intensify negative thinking by giving it attention, or do we ignore it as the illusion it is?\n\nPlease read what I wrote again, this time with the point-of-view of seeing thoughts, emotions, body signals exactly as they are - fleeting, passing, in most cases habit-formed.  \n\nIn the end, the trick is to be able to differentiate from habitual thinking, to real insights."],

"responses":[ "Yes! I do the same thing and it does help me to break my sugary habits.I also learned more about what sugar does to the body, generally most people are aware sugar is \"bad\"], but many (like myself few years ago) dont realize just how bad sugar is. It is basically like a drug, it not only messes with our physical well being but also with our emotional well being. Eating sugar gives us a \"high\" which doesnt last very long... we dont actually get full when consuming it and are therefore sad when we come off of it and are continuously hungry.\n\nI watched  [That Sugar Film](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6uaWekLrilY) documentary to educate myself better on the effects of sugar on my body - every time I eat sugar I also think about the things the documentary talks about. It was filmed in a specific kind of way not everyone might like, but I do recommend it. I still have some sugar in my diet, but when shopping and fighting sugary urges it helps. =)"

I just had a rough-ish breakup a month ago myself, shits not fun.\n\nPersonally when I’m feeling sadness or pain I don’t focus on my breath or physical sensations right away. I take time to really feel those emotions and give them the space they deserve. And after a short while I usually feel better (it wasn’t that bad of a breakup and I recovered quickly, idk your circumstances but I imagine it might not be so easy for you yet). Now if I start to dwell too much or have unproductive\/hateful thoughts that’s when I focus on my breath or something else to come back to the present moment.\n\nSo I think you’re right in a way. If you focused on your breath every time those feelings come up it would almost be running away from those emotions. Anyways, I hope you feel better soon."

Thank you.\n\nEdit:\n\nSo I gave this a try just now, and it was just what I needed. I was heavily into meditation many months ago, but due to some changes in life, I have been pulled away.\n\nI have tried to rejoin meditation recently, but I was finding that my mind was too noisy; when I would try, I couldn't reach the state that I once had, where I would feel completely empty. Now, I am restless and my mind wanders quickly my current situation, but also back to the things that brought me to discover meditation in the first place.\n\nI have tried to start small, but just sitting, and trying to clear my mind. However, thoughts would continually pop up and I would be pulled by them. I would push this thought aside, only to be quickly taken by another.\n\nAfter trying this meditation, I think I will be able to use this as a way to avoid that. By giving the thoughts that arise a label and setting them aside, it will help me to reduce the length of the distraction and help return faster and be in a state of \"gone\" for longer periods.\n\nOnce I get used to this, then I can return to the deeper meditations."

"patterns":["Annoyed by friends. Why?"],
"responses":[ "Anger is how we react when we believe that someone or something we care about is being harmed. My guess would be that you believe that gossip is harmful and so you prefer to not associate with people who do. When we discover that someone we regard(ed) as a friend is violating a value that feels important to us, it can feel like a betrayal, even though the friend may have different values and not have any loyalty to the value we think is important that they are violating (like not gossiping). From your description, my hunch is that the \"even deeper\" that you're asking about may be this feeling of betrayal that can result from this kind of situation.\n\nWe assumed our friend was a nice, good person. Then we see them do something that doesn't fit into our definition of what a \"nice, good\" person is like. That can call into question everything we thought we knew about them, as if they've been pretending to be someone they aren't. In fact, they probably never were pretending at all. They were just being themselves, but we had made assumptions about them that turned out to be incorrect. Having our assumptions challenged by reality can be surprising and painful and unsettling because it shows us that our world view is flawed.\n\nYour (former) friends' behavior tells you who they are. Your feelings tell you who you are. It's not your job to police other people's behavior. Your job is to be who you are to the best of your ability. Part of doing that is figuring out which relationships support you in being your best self and which get in the way and would best be let go.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing a good job of being true to yourself and your values, and I think that's an important quality to cultivate. On the other hand, it's possible to be too rigid and demanding, both of ourselves and others, so I'd encourage you to guard against that, too.\n\nWhen you're ready, it might be helpful to you to use a [forgiveness practice](https:\/\/www.dhammasukha.org\/forgiveness-meditation.html) with your friends in mind. You could also send them [metta](https:\/\/www.mettainstitute.org\/mettameditation.html).\n\nI hope some of this is helpful and that you find resolution and peace around this issue."

In fact the reason he started the farm is due to the Buddhist idea of doing as much good and dedicating yourself to the world. He phrased it as “if you open your heart to the world, you will never be lonely”."

A placeholder that represents all almond trees and the meaning our own mind personally attaches to them. \n \n \n\nWe have become so familiar with this introspective view of the world that even if the actual almond tree we're in front of us, we replace it with our own version of the imagined one.\n\n \n \nTo be in true communion with the tree, you must detach entirely from the world you \"know\" and enter the timeless realm where All exists in it's most pure form.\n\n \n\nEasier said than done... The key to unlocking this world is a \"still mind\". You must first discover where the tension within yourself lies and why. Eliminate all tension, free your mind, and the tree will reveal itself."

"responses":[ "You are very focused on getting rid of anxiety, which is of course understandable - it's such a terrible experience to have to live with. But I would suggest that this very attitude of needing to get rid of this experience of anxiety, might be perpetuating a lot of the suffering you have as a result of anxiety. \n\nYou say you are safe and everything is fine. But you also say you would rather die than keep living like this. That does not sound safe or fine to me. It sounds like a really good reason to be anxious. And then that anxiety makes you more anxious because it is the thing threatening your safety and well-being - which makes you more anxious. It's a vicious cycle. \n\nI think where meditation could help is giving you a space to sit with anxiety with a sense of curiosity, self-compassion, and courage. The threat of anxiety is that it is dangerous, or there is something dangerous that we are anxious about. By slowly and gently turning towards anxiety instead of turning away from it, you can, over time, teach your brain that this too is part of your human experience, and though unpleasant, it is not dangerous. This does require really accepting it - and not a conditional acceptance, oh I can accept this as long as it goes away after I meditate daily for 6 months. You don't have to accept that this is the rest of your life - but the work is to accept in any moment, that this is the way this moment is and it is worth being present for, even if it feels awful. \n\nSome practical tips based on my own experience (and success!) with this exact thing - \n\n- Treat your mediation sessions as experiments. You're not buying into anything, you're not forcing yourself to accept a whole part of your life you truly hate. You are just, for 10 minutes or however long, seeing what it would be like to do this practice, as an experiment. \n\n- Use audio guides. I find it really scary and overwhelming to just meditate alone when I am feeling very anxious. Find a teacher you trust and feel safe with, and use their audio guides much of the time. Especially meditations specifically about turning towards anxiety, creating a safe base, curiously exploring your inner landscapes, etc. \n\n- Meditate when you are feeling your best, the least anxious that you feel. This will give you a safe base and foundation of practice to also be able to meditate when you are feeling very anxious. Also mediate when you are feeling anxious, but take care of yourself - do shorter sessions, maybe lay down instead of sitting if that is good for you, or do whatever else you need to increase your sense of safety. Good luck!"

"responses":[ "Theres a theory that we do experience conciousness after death, but not in the way you'd think. All living things in nature produce a chemical called DMT. This is commonly known as a recreational drug that is often used in tribal communities for spirituality. It is a very powerful hallucinogen which usually causes people to see and believe they are in contact with an being such as aliens that created us, or some type of God that ends up guiding them in their trip and helping them understand themselves.\n\n\nThe kicker is that upon death humans and possibly other animals produce a very large amount of DMT in their brains. This is what is thought to cause the typical \"light\"], or people seeing God, the gates of heaven etc. when they are medically dead but somehow come back to life. The typical DMT trip only lasts a short period of time, but the effects of the drug make time feel like it is slower and a trip could feel like years.\n\nIt is theorized that when the body dies, this DMT release cause a trip until the brain eventually dies which could feel much much longer than the actual time it lasts. \n\nI believe this trip occurs and causes us to feel another short life-time where we hallucinate and reconcile our lives and our own deaths. After this I do agree that conciousness comes to an end."

I think you will see that your suffering is at root their suffering. Give them unconditional love. Hug them, talk to them. Sit with them. Soothe them. Tell them that now that you've found them you will strive hard to always be there for them. That you're inseparable. Develop a deep relationship with yourself in your heart center. \n\nDo this frequently. When you wake up, when you go to sleep, several times during the day.  Go to your inner child when you're feeling down, anxious, stressed, depressed. Heal their wounds. You can't fix what happened but you can reassure with love that they were in an impossible situation and give them the love to help them rise above it. You're getting a chance to re-parent your inner child. \n\nIn the beginning I even had the imaginary inner child bring me photos (which were probably more like memories) of the events that were terrifying for then and I was able to tell them how unfair that situation was, how brave they were, how innocent...and that I'm going to do my best to protect them if that memory arises or a similar situation presents itself.\n\nAfter a month or so this exercise morphed on its own to just directly loving myself (adult self loving adult self). I started to be my own best cheerleader and friend. My inner critical voice too has changed to one of unconditional love. \n\nI really hope this helps 🤗💜🌈\n\n"

Because this is a lens that perceives reality saying \"how do I get into the flow state\" \"what do I need to do\" \"is this the flow state\" \"am I doing it right?\" Everything you do from that lens will simply reflect the thought back to you that you are not in it yet. It's kinda like putting on a pair of glasses. If you have purple tinted glasses, you're going to see everything purple! The answer is to look beyond the lens through which you're viewing. The answer is to recognize that you will never find the answer in the question, but outside of it. The thought \"I am becoming aware of where my feet are\" \"what my hands are doing\" these too are thoughts disguised as \"mindfulness.\" Real flow state comes from simply being. My advice? You don't need to do anything at all. You don't need to change anything at all. You just need to be. Simple as that.  "

By the time I was 17 my tolerance for alcohol has peaked and was going down - meaning ti was taking a lot less to get me drunk and out of control. My mental and emotional state were the equivalent of a 3 year old. I couldn't \"connect\" emotionally with anyone and I certainly didn't believe that I was unique or gifted or anything special. In my mind, I was one of the few mistakes that God had made. I attempted suicide a few times, and truly believed I was alone in the world. \n\nAnd then I wasn't. After being put into a treatment facility by loving parents (no abuse, no neglect, yes they did love me and care for me), I learned about alcoholism and what was happening to my body, and my mind, and my emotional\/spiritual being. And then I was sent home. Dry as a bone with few skills to get me through each day that was filled with fear of people, places, and things.\n\nI sought, and found, like-minded people. I really didn't want to drink again, and more importantly I really wanted to try to live as normal a life as possible. The like-minded people I found were others who had stopped drinking and were living their lives with purpose. I had many conversations over kitchen tables with people willing to share their way of life with me. It was based a LOT on mindfulness and I soon took to it...finding myself no longer wanting to drink as I got in touch with my Life's purpose. \n\nToday, I can tell you that you are not alone. I can tell you that in order for you to believe that you're not alone you must find like-minded people who have stopped smoking and started living. Wherever they may be...that is where you need to be. With them. Learning how to live life a little differently while keeping true to yourself. Mindfulness plays a big part in your staying sober, while also being able to see that there is a tomorrow that is different than today - if you want it to be. \n\nHope is a powerful emotion. If you can get a glimpse of the Life you want, of how you want to feel, how you want to act, who you want to be hanging around with, the kind of work you want to do...and believe that it is possible for you...then you'll get through this, stop smoking completely, and learn how to stop sabotaging yourself.

"responses":[ "I think the most valuable practice is looking at yourself, not paying so much attention to the other person. Not taking something personally happens more and more easily as you start to understand your mind (and to some degree you thereby also understand other minds). Your mind moves around as others interact with you. It assumes things, it believes things, it thinks it knows things, it judges others.\n\nI recommend the turning around approach. A person is being mean. Ok, what does it trigger in me? How do I feel? How do I deeply feel? Do I feel unworthy, rejected? Do I feel bullied, do I feel helpless, as if there is nothing I can do about this meanness?\n\nThen a next thing for me is the conscious and very deliberate (and at times, yes, exhausting) intention to be understanding, be present, not be ruled by how I feel. Even if that means I need to separate myself for a moment this is still better than going on being angry and responding impulsively to my feelings, judging the other, and so on. That perpetual cycle has proved itself unhelpful again and again yet we continue to engage in it, hoping to change all others so they no longer frustrate us. How about us changing us so we no longer frustrate us? So I try to understand the other too. Why do they behave that way? Of course this is easier with small frustrations than with great rudeness. That's a given. But try, have the intention. What are they believing in that moment, and could it really be different? Understand it non-judgmentally.\n\nI can give you an example of a small victory, with a small frustration. That's the best place to start:\n\nI get on the bus, and I ask the bus driver: 'does this bus go to such and such street?' He replies: 'which one of the many do you mean?' and he laughed. Clearly I hadn't realised there are many streets by that name, and assumed he understood which one. So, I felt some irritation coming up over my embarasssment that he seemed to cause. The tendency was to get angry with him, and to blame him for my embarassment, because I perceived that he was shaming me. But he wasn't. I was shaming me. All he did was impulsively reacting in a way that may be insensitive, but surely he had a reason. Even if his reason was a lack of awareness or lack of care, he had a reason. He couldn't be different in that moment. So 'shoulding' him would be just as insensitive and shortsighted of me. His behavior doesn't make him a bad person, just a triggering one (in that moment). So I stayed present, and replied 'you're right, how silly of me. I mean this and this street specifically.' And he answered me, somewhat more politely. The point is to let go of our projections of blame. Sometimes we may even be right, and nevertheless we are still projecting -- *and the projection is all that matters*. Not whether we are right.\n\nSorry if that was a rant :)"

That's a given. But try, have the intention. What are they believing in that moment, and could it really be different? Understand it non-judgmentally.\n\nI can give you an example of a small victory, with a small frustration. That's the best place to start:\n\nI get on the bus, and I ask the bus driver: 'does this bus go to such and such street?' He replies: 'which one of the many do you mean?' and he laughed. Clearly I hadn't realised there are many streets by that name, and assumed he understood which one. So, I felt some irritation coming up over my embarasssment that he seemed to cause. The tendency was to get angry with him, and to blame him for my embarassment, because I perceived that he was shaming me. But he wasn't. I was shaming me. All he did was impulsively reacting in a way that may be insensitive, but surely he had a reason. Even if his reason was a lack of awareness or lack of care, he had a reason. He couldn't be different in that moment. So 'shoulding' him would be just as insensitive and shortsighted of me. His behavior doesn't make him a bad person, just a triggering one (in that moment). So I stayed present, and replied 'you're right, how silly of me. I mean this and this street specifically.' And he answered me, somewhat more politely. The point is to let go of our projections of blame. Sometimes we may even be right, and nevertheless we are still projecting -- *and the projection is all that matters*. Not whether we are right.\n\nSorry if that was a rant :)"],

"responses":[ "It does seem that way but confrontation even in meditation is a good thing. Keep in mind what I said might not be your situation - hard to say without knowing more - but one way to end up caught up in thought is by repressing them. You want to let them pass but to do so you have to let them float around for a bit if that's what the mind wants.\n\nInstead observe thoughts from a distance without participating. This is the key. Labeling thoughts internally for example is one way to distance yourself and watch yourself think instead of actually thinking. Give each thought a simple label. \"Thinking about...\" Notice how each one brings a sensation with it to the body while it's there. If you keep doing this the mind eventually calms down enough to let you spend more time in your body, and if it doesn't that day, keep at it and remember every session is a step in the right direction. It's perfectly ok to spend a session just working on shifting perspective to observation of thoughts. Especially on stressful days. On those days focusing on the basics can help the most."

"patterns":["I find hard to be mindful when Im not alone. Any suggestions?"],
"responses":[ "I'd suggest giving yourself a \"mindfulness trigger.\" That's something that you can do to remind yourself to be in a mindful state. When you're alone and practicing, give yourself the trigger. That creates the association between the trigger and the practice of mindfulness. Then you can use it when you wish. The trigger can be whatever you like. I use a couple of deep steady breaths, since I do breath awareness regularly any way. Another alternative would be to tap out a complex pattern on your body with your fingers. You could tap out your ATM PIN for instance. Just something deliberate that takes a hint of concentration. It'll give you a little break from your emotions and remind you to pay attention to being mindful.\n\nAnother suggestion would be to think about what it means to be mindful when you're with others. At least part of that should be immersing yourself in the experience of interacting with them, usually through talk. So, dive in. Listen intently to what they're saying. Ask questions, lots of them. Be empathetic. Compliment them. Savor the moments you're spending by getting a lot out of them. Appreciate them and who they are, good, bad and neutral.\n\nThis has several effects you might appreciate. One, you'll hit your goal of being mindful (yeah, we shouldn't be too goal-oriented, but I know where you're coming from). Second, you'll be more enjoyable to be around, because everyone loves to be around a good listener who's interested in them. Lastly, it reduces that feeling of having to \"perform\" in a social situation. You get to be a reflector, not a light. "

It is not an existence, which is perishable. It is not an emptiness, which is a mere void. It has neither color nor form. It enjoys no pleasures and suffers no pains.*\n\n*\"I know you are very ill. Like a good Zen student, you are facing that sickness squarely. You may not know exactly who is suffering, but question yourself: What is the essence of this mind? Think only of this. You will need no more. Covet nothing. Your end which is endless is as a snowflake dissolving in the pure air.\"*"],

"responses":[ "Exactly right. We have (basically) two kinds of thought patterns: unconscious thoughts and conscious thoughts. Unconscious thoughts make up the bulk of our thinking and are all those random thoughts that our mind generates as an evolutionary trait: judgements, emotions (which are just thoughts with motivations attached to them), worries & regrets, rumination and pointless planning, etc. this is unguided\/uncontrolled thought. \nConscious thinking is when we are focusing on a task and\/or problem solving. Basically, guided\/controlled thoughts. \nSo what you said is perfect: when you become aware of your (unconscious) thoughts, you notice that they just end. That moment is where the power is. In that moment you get to make a choice, do I decide to continue thinking about that subject (and purposefully switch from unconsciously thinking about it to consciously thinking about it), or do you allow that train of thought to fade off in the distance, rather than pursuing it. \nThis is outside of meditation, of course. \nSo, when I realize I am unconsciously thinking, I ask myself a very simple question: “Is this helpful?”  \nUnderstanding the fact that our minds have developed\/evolved for threat detection (not happiness) really helps. That’s why the bulk of our unconscious thoughts are (if you examine them closely) negative in nature. \nAlmost 100% of the time, because our unconscious thoughts are - by nature\/evolution - geared towards negativity or as an attempt to control the uncontrollable, they are NOT helpful. They only produce low or high grade stress & anxiety. \nIf we are not being mindful, we follow our thoughts relentlessly because we are unaware of their effect on us.\nIt is debatable that Viktor Frankl ever actually said or originated this, but I still love the quote:\n“Between stimulus and responses there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our responses. In our responses lies our growth and our freedom.”\nIn the case of thinking, the “stimulus” he mentions is the moment we become aware of our unconscious thinking. The “responses” is what we choose to do with that awareness: do we recognize the negativity and futility of the thought process & just let it go, or do we continue down the rabbit hole in more stress-inducing, “unskillful” thoughts. \nIt isn’t a “one & done” thing though. We keep applying this to as many moments as we can throughout the day. \nWe become more mindful. "

I'm not going to claim I've got it under control, but it's certainly a lot better for me these days than it used to be. \n\nDo you meditate? I use an app called Calm, and tend to do a session of at least 10 minutes right before bed, as I think that helps settle me for sleep. I imagine you're like me and wake up in the middle of the night with your brain immediately alert - this seems to stop the mind from wandering too far in those moments. I also take the chance to occasionally meditate at other times, like if I know it's been a long day at work and I manage to get a seat on the bus, I'll switch on Calm and shut out the world for 10. It does seem to help with the subconscious worry I'm not even aware of.\n\nThe other part (and this takes time) is acceptance, or not fighting it. It sounds counter intuitive, and I'm not talking about embracing panic attacks or anything (although some people say you should, I find that is a bit too much). Instead I've come to realise that this is me, and it's just something I have to deal with. By acknowledging who you are, all aspects of you good and bad, you reduce the potential harm of these things. Accept that sometimes you will have bad moments or bad days, they will suck, but they will pass.\n\nHope that helps and good luck."

More and more leaders in the corporate world have been taking note of the benefits of meditation, which include lower stress levels, improved cognitive functioning, creative thinking and productivity, and even improved physical health. A number of Fortune 500 companies, including Google, AOL, Apple and Aetna, offer meditation and mindfulness classes for employees -- and the top executives of many major corporations say that meditation has made them better leaders.\n\n\nFord Motor Company chairman Bill Ford and former Google.org director Larry Brilliant are also among the executives advocating the mindfulness practice. Here are 10 influential business leaders who say meditation has helped them achieve (and sustain) a high level of success.\n\n\n1. Rupert Murdoch, Chairman and CEO, News Corp\nrupert murdoch\n\n\nNews Corp CEO Rupert Murdoch recently tweeted that he was trying out Transcendental Meditation, a popular technique developed in the 1960s and followed today by famous practitioners like Oprah, David Lynch and Candy Crowley.\n\n\nThe media tycoon said on Twitter in April, \"Everyone recommends, not that easy to get started, but said to improve everything!\"\n\n\n2. Padmasree Warrior, CTO, Cisco Systems\npadmasree\n\n\nWarrior, the chief technology and strategy officer of Cisco Systems, meditates every night and spends her Saturdays doing a \"digital detox.\" In her previous role as Cisco's head of engineering, Warrior oversaw 22,000 employees, and she told the New York Times in 2012 that taking time to meditate and unplug helped her to manage it all.\n“It’s almost like a reboot for your brain and your soul,” she said. “It makes me so much calmer when I’m responding to e-mails later.”\n\n\n3. Tony Schwartz, Founder & CEO, The Energy Project\n\n\ntony schwartz renewal\nThe Energy Project CEO Tony Schwartz has been meditating for over 20 years. He originally started the practice to quiet his busy mind, according to his book What Really Matters: Searching for Wisdom in America. Schwartz says that meditating has freed him from migraines and helped him develop patience, and he also advocates mindfulness as a way to improve work performance.\n\n\n\"Maintaining a steady reservoir of energy -- physically, mentally, emotionally and even spiritually -- requires refueling it intermittently,\" Schwartz wrote in a Harvard Business Review blog.\n\n\n4. Bill Ford, Executive Chairman, Ford Motor Company\nbill ford\n\n\nThe Ford Motor Company chairman is a big proponent of meditation in the business world, according to Inc. Magazine. At this year's Wisdom 2.0 conference, Ford was interviewed by leading American Buddhist teacher Jack Kornfield. Ford told Kornfield that during difficult times at the company, he set an intention every morning to go through his day with compassion. And to lead with compassion, Ford said he first learned to develop compassion for himself through a loving-kindness (metta) meditation practice.\n\n\n5. Oprah Winfrey, Chairwoman & CEO, Harpo Productions, Inc.\noprah weight body image ego\n\n\nAn outspoken advocate of Transcendental Meditation, Oprah -- recently named the most powerful celebrity of 2013 by Forbes -- has said she sits in stillness for 20 minutes, twice a day. She's also brought in TM teachers for employees at Harpo Productions, Inc. who want to learn how to meditate.\n\n\nAfter a meditation in Iowa last year, Oprah said, \"I walked away feeling fuller than when I'd come in. Full of hope, a sense of contentment, and deep joy. Knowing for sure that even in the daily craziness that bombards us from every direction, there is -- still -- the constancy of stillness. Only from that space can you create your best work and your best life.\"\n\n\n6. Larry Brilliant, CEO, Skoll Global Threats Fund\nlarry brilliant\n\n\nLarry Brilliant, CEO of the Skoll Global Threats Fund and former director of Google.org, spent two years during his 20s living in a Himalayan ashram and meditating, until his guru instructed him to join a World Health Organization team working to fight smallpox in New Delhi.\nIn his 2013 commencement address at the Harvard School of Public Health, Brilliant emphasized the importance of peace of mind, wishing the graduates lives full of equanimity -- a state of mental calm and composure.\n\n\n7. Ray Dalio, Founder & Co-CIO, Bridgewater Associates USA\nray dalio\n\n\nIn a 2012 conversation at the John Main Centre for Meditation and Inter-Religious Dialogue at Georgetown University, Dalio said that meditation has opened his mind and boosted his mental clarity.\n\n\n\"Meditation has given me centeredness and creativity,\" said Dalio. \"It's also given me peace and health.\"\n\n\n8. Russell Simmons, Co-Founder, Def Jam Records; Founder of GlobalGrind.com\nrussell simmons\n\n\nHip-hop mogul Russell Simmons has long practiced Transcendental Meditation, speaking out about the benefits of the practice and sitting on the board of the advisors for the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace.\n\n\n\"You don't have to believe in meditation for it to work,\" Simmons wrote in a Huffington Post blog. \"You just have to take the time to do it. The old truth is still true today, 'God helps those who help themselves.' My advice? Meditate.\"\n\n\n9. Robert Stiller, CEO, Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc.\nrussell simmons\n\n\nThere is a dedicated meditation room at the Vermont headquarters of Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc., and CEO Robert Stiller himself is a devoted practitioner.\n\n\n\"If you have a meditation practice, you can be much more effective in a meeting,\" he told Bloomberg in 2008. \"Meditation helps develop your abilities to focus better and to accomplish your tasks.\"\n\n\n10. Arianna Huffington, President & Editor-in-Chief, Huffington Post Media Group\narianna huffington\n\n\nAnd last but not least, Arianna Huffington described early-morning yoga and meditation as two of her \"joy triggers\" in a 2011 Vogue feature. Now, Huffington has brought meditation into her company, offering weekly classes for AOL and Huffington Post employees.\n\n\nHuffington has spoken out on the benefits of mindfulness not just for individual health, but also for corporate bottom lines. \"Stress-reduction and mindfulness don't just make us happier and healthier, they're a proven competitive advantage for any business that wants one,\" she wrote in a recent blog."

You can daydream at some point during the day, and do some mindfulness at another point. Good luck! \n\n(I really like Practicing Mindfulness, by Matthew Sockolov, if that helps.

A lot of people seem to think that the pain is a good anchor but maybe it's a bit too much to start with.\n\nI have my own little mindfulness session in the shower. I sit on the ground, knees pulled up, and watch the water drops on my knees. I focus on one at a time and watch as it falls. Then I focus on another one.\n\nMindfulness is about awareness. And about concentration. So find something to concentrate on, anything. My psychlogist told me the other day that drinking tea and studying the tea bag closely is also mindfulness. It keeps you in touch with the now. And the focus can clear your mind and let you observe your mind better.\n\nHope this helps. And I'm sorry about your breathing, that sounds terrible."

Naming emotions in context of meditation might not always be the best thing to do, but I promise that it helps. If you know what you feel, you're already one step closer to controlling emotions.

"responses":[ "The relaxing effect of meditation will take you right out of this mode of thinking, as you said, but I really believe this is the result of a pattern of thought that only comes out when you give in to fear (and when you are not in a quiet and safe space.) Meditation kind of numbs your reaction to fear, (or you might say it makes it less potent), but more useful, I think is to make a mental note when you find yourself judging your spoken performance, as you are doing here. You can be calm sitting, but everyone experiences a slight elevation in adrenaline etc. around other people, so this makes us much more likely to make mistakes. But this is perfectly fine! Notice there is no loop in that pattern. You just make a mistake and move on, less likely to make the mistake again. Loops \/ cycles are anxiety, which is basically you trying to reflect on yourself critically, but since you are both the critic and the performer, it doesn't work well. It makes you feel bad when in reality you would perform your best if you felt good. So meditation, gratefulness, giving, self-love, taking care of yourself, exercise, all of these things actually help you to perform better. And hopefully, you'll make more mistakes and be able to hop through the critical thoughts and keep trying. Maybe you'll have the peace of mind to giggle at your clumsiness.\n\nNone of this comes easy, but over time you will learn to take the pressure off yourself. Just be aware of your intentions and set small goals for yourself. Being aware of your intentions keeps you in check when you falter, and setting small goals helps teach you where you are.\n\nBut most of all, realize that were all fumbling through life, the least you can do is to do your dance, however silly it might feel to you. Strength is the ability to come back around after adversity. It is not the ability to make no mistakes. When you follow your heart it will lead you through your faults to a stronger and more confident place. The heart gives you the courage to be who you are."

And one can certainly make an ethical distinction between obtaining that state in service to the rest of creation, as would be the traditional approach.\n\nAll that being said, I totally get your distinction that unlike other ways of experiencing this state, meditation does not involve anything external. I just feel that, as an experience, it's not qualitatively different. Then again, I've only ever been in that state while playing music (jazz piano), never though meditation, so it's entirely possible I am completely missing something that can only be experienced directly."],

"responses":[ "Keep living your life! The first time I notably experienced one was through psychedelics and I remember it changed my whole perspective on life and made me look more into the general subject of ego dissolution. The thing is that we all operate in our egos so it’s inevitable to return to our normal sense of self. But now since you had that experience, you know your normal sense of self is relative & just one of many experiences you can have. Use this wisdom to be more compassionate and understanding of people’s predicaments in this world. If you’re interested in returning to the egoless state, you can practice different forms of meditation & intensify that practice, read literature on the subject, and use psychedelics occasionally. \n\nUsing it as an opportunity to rebuild is beautiful and how I looked at it too. Just live your life like I said, but continue to be curious and investigate each part of your life. I remember shortly after my first experience, I even asked “why should I even eat breakfast?” It can be as simple as that\n\nA resource that was a shifting point in my understanding was Be Here Now by Ram Dass. All his lectures helped too. Similar lecturers would be Alan watts, Timothy Leary, and Terrence McKenna. "

"responses":[ "This is a great description of what I try to achieve with mindfulness. Treat your emotions like things you can look at it. Evaluate them. Assign them properties. Analyze them. They are not real, and do not exist in the outside world. The more you can think of them as stand-alone things, rather than properties that define you, the more you see them as inconsequential, and there is much relief in that thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, OP, I recognize a pattern in your post here, that you believe your facial expressions define your appearance. I believe that stems from a deep concern over what other people think about you. I think objectively, people are not really looking at you and paying attention to your facial expressions. They're not thinking much about you at all. You're the center of your own universe, but not theirs. This is one of the realizations that mindfulness helped me to arrive at. It took a lot of time and practice, and was accompanied by some other supporting thoughts, including this epiphany: so much of what we worry about just doesn't matter at all. \n\nI hope you get there.

"responses":[ "Hi, Fran! Your English is great! You've got an interesting thing going on there. Mindfulness might help, though I'll say it will be difficult to understand the causes of this behavior from a distance over the internet, so please continue to see your psychologist as frequently as you can afford to. Also, I was alarmed at your statement of \"suicidal thoughts lol.\" If you haven't already, let your psychologist know about that. He or she will add some differing approaches to your therapy and hopefully work you through that quickly. In the meantime, know that you'll get through this, and that it's worth getting through. \n\nI'll focus just on your mindfulness and meditation for advice here. I see one flaw in your meditation practice, and that's that you're trying to fight your thoughts. You're trying to wrestle them back to your breathing and away from the door. The usual advise there would be to acknowledge and accept that these thoughts are occurring, then gently move your thoughts back to your breath. There's a big difference between wrestling your thoughts back and gently redirecting them, though, and I think that's where you're struggling. How do you accept this strong, overwhelming feeling, and let it pass enough to get back to paying attention to your breath? \n\nI have a couple of thoughts. First, try evaluating the feeling as an \"outside observer.\" By that I mean, think about the feeling rather then dive in and experience the feeling. One trick I've used is to assign a number for how strong the feeling is from 1 to 10. I have to think and compare prior experiences to do that. I have to kind of step outside the feeling itself and become an observer of it. An impartial evaluator. \"Only a three.\" or \"Wow, that's a seven.\" Next, ask, \"why is it that number?\" It'll help you continue the process of evaluating rather than experiencing. \"Well, it's only a three because I really was paying good attention to my breath a second ago so I'm not fully obsesses by the door yet.\" Or, \"it's a seven because I had an emotional difficult day today so all of my feelings are frayed and easily overstimulated.\" Then, say to yourself, \"OK, I've looked at this feeling I was having. Huh. That was interesting. Now, let me pay attention to my breath again.\" You can do that as often as you need to. And if it feels like meditation isn't working out, go ahead and take a break and try again later.\n\nNext, consider this: there's something interesting about your desire to stare with your peripheral vision, rather than directly. I can't figure that out over the internet, and I bet your psychologist has either a) seen it a million times and completely understands it or b) finds you pretty interesting or both! In any case, one of the things I'll suggest is that if it continues to interrupts your meditation, try this: indulge in it, but not peripherally. Move your eyes and your head and look at the door. And I mean really look at it. Notice it's proportions, it's texture, it's color, it's light and shadows, the hinges, the frame, the paintwork. Immerse yourself in the visual experience of that door. Immersing yourself in a visual experience as deeply as you can is a form of meditation. And to the extent that meditation can be beneficial to you, I think it would help. Also, I think the interesting part of you is the need to stare peripherally,and I think breaking that a bit and just staring outright during your meditation would satisfy the distraction and let you get back to your breath. Run this past your psychologist, because he or she might have a differing opinion, and I'd prefer you follow their advice over mine.\n\nWhich brings me to my final thought: meditation is only part of the practice of mindfulness. Some people never really get good at it. There are plenty of other ways to be mindful. Just paying attention to your senses throughout the day is one. I'm a big fan of mindful eating, as well. Overall, your goal should be to spend more time paying attention to the world around you (yeah, look at it, straight on!) and a little less time in your thoughts and emotions. It helps because you learn how little time the rest of the people in the world actually spend thinking about you. You're only the center of the universe in your own mind, not everyone else's. There's a lot - LOT - less judgement about you going on than you currently think. And spending some time in the world of sensations will make that obvious. And it's relieving when it sinks in.\n\nFran, be kind to yourself. Forgive yourself these things you see as flaws. You'll find relief, and will move on to accomplish other parts of your life. "

It's what I do. I know some other people meditate sitting in a chair facing a blank wall. You might consider facing an empty corner if you wanted your eyes open.

As a fellow human that has suffered from 20+ years of depression (and it is an ongoing, daily battle), medication (although it can have side effects) is occasionally the truly responsible thing to do. It sounds like you have a healthy respect for the disease and yourself (good!), so don’t ever consider yourself weak for needing medication. In my mind, many people need a multi-sided treatment program: medication, therapy, exercise, and meditation\/mindfulness. Like the other responder said - leave no stone unturned. You are worth it. \nThat said, I have been medication free myself for about 5 years - and my meditation\/mindfulness practice has been the thing that made all the difference. That and two phrases two separate friends gifted me with. The first was a lesson in impermanence - although written on the subject of creativity. He said creativity was like the waves and troughs on the ocean; it comes in surges and then subsides. Even when you are at your least creative (and possibly feeling down about it), you can always look forward to the next rise. I immediately had an epiphany that correlated this with my emotions. In that moment, I understood that nothing lasted forever - including my depression. It was something I already knew, but didn’t fully understand, in my core. That simple lesson was like realizing there is always a door out of a frequently VERY dark room. I still get depressed, but I catch it much earlier on now (thanks to mindfulness), and can guide myself out of it much more efficiently (thanks to the reminder that it is not a permanent condition). I have found, just knowing and remembering that it will pass often times catapults me out of it. \nThe second phrase given by a different friend, as I was going through one of the darkest times of my life, was “this is the teacher you need right now.” It pissed me off to no end because, at the time, it sounded like a damn riddle. Did he think he was Yoda or something? It took several years to fully sink in. Every moment is an opportunity to learn, develop, and grow. It makes “life a classroom” and an ongoing evolution. One phrase and I’m never bored - because there is always something to be learned. It reminds me, in my most challenging & frustrating moments, that there is something I can learn from this. \nI don’t know if these phrases will help you in your journey. I hope they do. "

"responses":[ "I've been going through a similar process with physical sensations. Often if I try to hone in on a sensation in my awareness, my mind begins to generate random images to \"represent\" the sensation. If I maintain my intention long enough, eventually the representations fade and the actual sensation begins to arise.\n\nFrom one asocial stoner to another, weed is what got me started with this practice and helps a lot, since it's easiest to do when your mind is in a slow but receptive state. When the mind is slow and nonreceptive, you'll forget your intention over and over again. If the mind is attentive and moving fast, it'll jump all over the sensation and start generating random and mostly useless thoughts centered around it.\n\nIn fact, when you start to observe these factors and how they change over time you gain a greater awareness of your state of mind from moment to moment. All you need to do is keep coming back to your intention. It's just like meditation."

"responses":[ "I tend to think that “daydreaming” is any unintentional thought. It’s the subconscious expressing itself. One of the current theories, as I (a layman) understand it, is that the mind has multiple modules - each tasked with a separate responsibility. These modules are constantly producing thoughts, each one vying for our ultimate attention and each one holding the potential to become a daydream or train of thought. It’s part of our survival mechanism (Thanks, evolution. You made us crazy.) \nThe difference between this and conscious thought is choice. \nMeditation is simply training wheels - a batting cage,if you will. It trains us to become more mindful of our thoughts (conscious or not). Awareness leads to choice. "

"responses":[ "I can identify with this. Example: we had a piece of diagnostic equipment malfunctioning in our clinic. The tech sent in to repair it was not very good at communicating how long it would take to be back online and a few of our employees were upset by not knowing how long the equipment would be down. They were even more upset by my (apparent) lack of agitation by the whole situation. They became frustrated with me because I wasn’t frustrated like they were. I explained they were mistaking acceptance for apathy. I just didn’t see the point in wasting energy in anger or frustration when it wasn’t going to solve anything or speed the situation along. Their frustration, with the tech & his lack of communication, and with me & my lack of frustration, was just a sub\/unconscious attempt at controlling a situation outside of their control. \n\nIf you think sanely about an event like this, you find that acceptance is a far more sane act than getting angry over something beyond your control. What’s the point? Is anger helping this (it rarely does)? Or, more importantly, is anger hurting me (it usually is)?\n\nMindful action is what a more sane person does in responses to any stimulus. In traffic, a non-mindful person gets cut off and displays road-rage. A mindful person gets cut off and recognizes the rising frustration and decides not to pursue it because they recognize several factors involved: 1) I can’t control other drivers 2) the driver who cut me off was not targeting me specifically - they would have cut off any other driver had they been in my position 3) perhaps that driver has an emergency they were racing\/responding to 4) the person who cut me off, like me, is not perfect 5) the person who cut me off may have been lost in thought and is suffering inside (allowing us to show them compassion, rather than rage) 6) etc, etc. \nAll of these factors link back to one way of thinking: getting upset at situations beyond our control is a waste of energy and helps no one. \n\nTLDR - people are frustrated by other people when their action\/responses doesn’t match their expectations of what their actions\/responses should be. That’s a fault in a perception of others though, not necessarily in the responses. "

But as someone who literally just returned home from 3 weeks travel I also struggle with the challenges of traveling and developing relationships as time ticks down to the end of holiday. Trying to add to @Alltogethernow ‘s responses I see it this way: \n\n\n**The SUPERFICIAL struggle**\nPeople experience joy where I experience repulsion. This is clearly ego, and thus\n\n**The MINDFULNESS struggle**\n it is a useful exercise to not become attached to that ego and \n\n**The DEEP struggle**\ngenuinely accept the terms that other people apply when they enjoy given circumstance.\n\nExercising conscious effort to begin the discovery process for me included traveling these four stages of wisdom: \n1. Unconscious Incompetence \n2. Conscious incompetence \n3. Unconscious Competence \n4. Conscious competence \n\nWhat you are discovering is your ego: your emotional, physical, or mental reactions to experiences, which are simply where you are as time moves, each second, another experience compounded on top of one another: or life as our ego knows it: \n\n1st REACTING EMOTIONALLY indifferent, upset, or happy (speaking extremely broadly, and likely out of order, just for example)\n**Processing Emotional Reactions** (1A)\n\n2nd PHYSICAL BEHAVIOR: continue breathing as if nothing changed, escape the situation (flight), persevere (fight) seek resources to continue forward, whatever forward is to you, continue unintentional, unconscious, or incompetent, effectively un-constructive behaviors (freeze) \n**Processing Physical Reactions** (2A)\n\n3rd: MENTAL REACTION, neutral, discourage, encourage the mental fortitude requires for daily mindfulness. This seems to be where one would get enlightened, find internal peace, and exercise the self care, love, gratitude, forgiveness, etc that you must ultimately desire for yourself in order for you to relatively build up those around you as you aspire to receive. We all have a common energy, desire for strength in numbers, community, and ultimately identifying what others enjoy that you do not like, but genuinely accept the terms the other person enjoys something you repulse, \n**Processing MENTAL REACTIONS** (3A)\n\nThese stages of experience occur whether you like it or not, all we can do is exercise at a pace of conscious development for competence. \n\nQ. How do you apply it to your circumstances? It sounds like you have an idea of a superficial reaction, you need more comfortable beds. \n\nQ.. What other identified themes do you see as reactions are triggered? Good and bad reactions are generally the easiest to see first.\n\nQ... And how you can manage, cope, develop your reactions to traveling? Time, patience, & repetition are critical here. \n\nWriting this has been extremely therapeutic to myself actually not just because I returned from travel but I struggle with self started mindfulness and the discipline aspect. I mean believe it or not, I wrote this after smoking a bowl first thing upon arriving home with my neighbors. \n\nThe more common alternative responses scares the shit out of me, even if it’s not objective refusal to self discover and condition yourself for convenience and complacency. I.e. never leave your comfort zone, equating zone to your space (& time) discovered physically (or mentally) through travel. \n\nTo me it might be you choose to avoid travel at all costs, refusing to delve deeper into the why the destructive reaction(s) on the surface. To me, travel is how we gain experiences with each other, literally and figuratively the only thing that sets us apart with AI or robots. The experiences with others naturally and collectively makes us whole, as we each face our ego, together, harmoniously. \n\n 🔸🔸📝❤️🙏🔐🌎☮️📝❤️🙏🔐🌎☯️🔹🔹\n\nRecently I came up with a mantra that may help the need for daily mindfulness: \nPOWERFULLY ACCOUNTABLE EFFORTLESSLY\nGet PAE’d\n"

For me it presents as tension in my shoulders neck and jaw, sometimes I'll clench my fists, no matter how it presents if I catch it I'll explore where the emotion is coming from and what it's trying to tell me. Really the only answer is more mindfulness and awareness of the here and now and that's not always easy when anger or sadness come into play.

"patterns":["Focusing on the sensations in the body is much more important than focusing on the content of thoughts. The body is as much part of the mind as train of thought is, and it sometimes feels like a direct line to your subconscious. The more you pay attention to the sensations in the body, the more you notice the intricacies and how frequent these feelings are. I’m kind of rambling, but I just wanted to comment because feelings in the body are such an important aspect of Mindfulness and can greatly enhance your understanding of yourself."],
"responses":[ "I heard recently that a good way to focus on the sensation that precedes a thought or urge is to try to remain conscious when the thought or urge arises, then be curious and ask yourself what is causing that? Or where did that come from?  Your curiosity should (theoretically) intrinsically motivate you to honestly search and follow the breadcrumbs back to the source. The more you notice the thought or urge arise and get curious about its origin, the better you will get at this. Hope this helps"

"patterns":["Is mindfulness compatible with focus?"],
"responses":[ "This question has come up before, and has whether it's compatible with creativity. I think if you just consider the definition of mindfulness, of existing the moment and experiencing sensations, then its incompatible with spending long periods in your head. But then, the practice of meditation has extended my ability to concentrate, and thus my ability to more thoroughly enjoy books, projects, etc. I ended up concluding that the practice of mindfulness is compatible, in that it has trained my brain to be able to choose where to pay attention. So, I can choose to focus on sensations of reality or I can choose to dive into a book.\n\nAnother way I think about it is this: I can savor a book the same way I can savor a meal. It's just another input to my brain. Yes, the things I'm imagining as I read don't exist and the emotions are purposefully evoked by the author. But, if you think about it, all your experiences, even the most mindful, are products of your brain. You've never had an experience of any thing that hasn't been your brain taking a collection of sensory inputs and wrapping them in layers of interpretation. So, my imagination to me is part of my brain's inputs, like my  eyes, ears, tongue, etc. I can pay attention to them, too.\n\nTwo other quick thoughts: I'm seeing a pattern of \"mindfulness guilt\" - a question of whether this or that thing you enjoy is good or bad in the context of  mindfulness dogma. I don't see that as a productive line of thought. Define mindfulness the way you want, and practice the way you wish.\n\nFinally, mindfulness has gotten in the way of enjoying movies and books for me, even though I can concentrate better. I am now more aware of the construction. I can see the actors acting, the directors direction and the author writing. I have to work to restore my suspension of disbelief. This sense comes and goes for me, and I can recognize it happening and have learned to move away from it and just enjoy the damn movie if that's what I want to do. "

Although, it is nice to mindfully do some dishes and get into a state of flow! My two cents! Hope any of this is helpful to you on your journey :)"

One kind of practice that can be useful in this case is body-focus practices like Tai Chi, Yoga, or Qigong.  Anchoring in the body can help concentrate the mind and can also activate the parasympathetic system to calm the mind.  Breath practice and seated meditation rock, but they can often leave a lot of space for thoughts\/emotions to rise and if these are intense, it may be hard to come back to the breath.   \n\n\nTl;dr: Totally normal and while right now it's like this, it won't always be."

Many \"yoga\" programs are more like gymnastic stretching classes with a focus on exercise or flexibility rather than a body awareness practice.  Not that that is bad, but if you look for a local yoga class, I'd recommend trying to get a sense if it is a class that will include body concentration practices or if the instructor will focus on caloric burn and such.

Then I begin my breathing exercises. sometimes I force air in sometimes I just breath naturally. I often fluctuate between the two. Again, this is sometimes only provides a temporary relief but I try to find love in the that I know that I am going in the right direction. Today is a particularly rough day for me and I have been feeling off all week. Find hope in the little battles won. If you can feel relaxation if only for even a fleeting moment that is something that you will be able to build upon going forward. Look at the areas that you may be feeling tense and see if you can breath into them. This has helped me tremendously. If thoughts pop into my head which has never not been the case, I try to observe them with love and compassion and move back into my breath. Again, this is often easier said than done but over the last year I have greatly improved my state of mind\/being and I find hope in that. PM if you like...have a beautiful weekend. MUCH LOVE."

Part of the benefit I've gotten from the practice is to be able to observe my emotions in the same way I might observe a mountain or a potato - just another thing. It took me a while to get there, and I focused specifically on that goal, and learned and created particular practices toward achieving it. Once I got there, I could pretty reliably step outside my emotional responses to an event, and observe my reaction. And that gave me the ability to ask \"why\" pretty calmly. \"Why am I feeling this?\" \"Oh, I'm having this feeling again, what's the cause.\" \"Let's trace this feeling backward and see if I can tell what actually triggered it.\" One of the truths it revealed to me is that my emotional responses is entirely non-factual, and entirely an internal creation of my own. That's an easy thing to say, but it took a while before it sank in for me. And once it did, I was able to disconnect the events from the emotions - meaning, I recognize that me having an emotion is because I have a reason for having it, not because of the event that \"caused\" it. If that event had another person involved, I knew my emotional responses had nothing to do with that person. It's just me. I create these thoughts, and they're mine to analyze, enjoy or dislike as I choose. They have nothing to do with the person or events that brought me there. \n\nA second thought that's more directly related to anger at people: research the practice of \"compassion meditation.\" It aligns with your mantra of \"bless them. change me,\" though I'll also add here that I'm not big on mantras. To me, they reduce important thoughts to mere words. So, let me lay out  my approach to compassion. When someone does something that irritates me, I make the effort to explore these thoughts: \"I am feeling an emotion caused by that person's actions. That emotion is something I created in my head, not a fact or tangible thing. I have, and will never have, a real understanding of why they did that, and it's not important that I do. It's unlikely it had anything to do with me.  I don't not understand their life, nor what brought them here. All I can do is forgive them and move on with things that are more important than this perceived problem.\"\n\nThat came out more clumsy than I try to execute it, but hopefully you get the idea. I'll throw out two related practices that you can play with when you're not experiencing anger. First, when you're in a crowd, pick someone and try to find something you really like about them. It can be anything, how they wear their hard, their clothes, the way they walk, that they seemed relaxed, something they said, etc. It helps to learn to appreciate people, and over time, it helps more to try this with people you share less in common with. The other practice I like is to pick a random person and watch them, and try to feel a little empathy for what they're doing (e.g. you see someone reading a label in a grocery store - why? Maybe they're trying to lose weight, or they have high blood pressure and need to reduce their sodium.) Whether you're right or wrong isn't important, just that you try to understand something about this person as a game. Then, to conclude the game, wish them the best (in your head - don't be a psycho to strangers.) Even simply thinking, \"I hope you have a better day\" is a good thing. There's a lot of power in forcing yourself to be positive toward other people, especially when what you're trying to solve is negativity towards others.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGood luck with this. It's an interesting outcome of mindfulness practice. I don't know if anything I've said will help, but I do sincerely hope it gets better for you."

The feeling of being inadequate can come from several things. Like not accepting yourself as you are or putting expectations on yourself that you can't really meet. It kinda sounds weird, but by not trying so hard (the attitude of non-striving), you feel better about yourself and more content. Doesn't mean that you don't try to achieve goals and things like that, but it means that you do strain for goals already whole and complete. It's easy to fall into the trap of thinking: I just have to change this way or accomplish that, and then I will be whole, but that never tends to happen. At times when I ruminate a lot I also feel difficult and conflicting emotions in my body. It does take time, and patience, by observing and distancing yourself from rumination before it gets better. If you have been ruminating for a long time, changes doesn't happen overnight. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother amazing thing with awareness is that you can respond in a better way to challenges and difficulties that life will throw at you again and again. We will never escape this, but we can change our responses. We can see difficulties as a way of growing and trust ourselves to overcome it.

Mindfulness is for developing stability of mind.  So don't follow sensations.\n\n> Should I be noticing and letting go of thoughts that bring my attention to the breath, or thoughts that try to keep me focused there?\n\nYou should notice exactly what arises in your experience.  If a thought arises notice it.  Then notice the intention to bring attention back to the breath.  Then notice the breath.  Then bring attention back to the breath.  If the thought keeps arising then keep noticing it.\n\nEventually, with enough stability of mind you will see that returning to the breath and staying on the breath doesn't require thinking.  If you can't help but think then your mind isn't under your control. \n Just notice the lack of control.  Mindfulness is the development of control.\n\n  >Maybe managerial thoughts are not so much helping me notice the breath as much as thinking about the breath?\n\nWell, they can be helpful.  Letting go isn't really the way.  Noticing is the way.  Through noticing a person lets go.\n\n>I mostly just feel anxious about not doing this correctly.\n\nNotice that anxiety.\n\n> I don't feel anxious during the meditation, but afterwards I wonder if what I'm doing is actually helpful or if I'm doing it wrong...\n\nDon't relegate the effort of developing mindfulness to a few minutes.  When anxiety arises just notice it.  That is the practice.  \n"

In both cases, one is a result of the other.\n\nI don't mean to discourage you from 'meditating' all the time, if by meditate you mean pay attention to your present moment-to-moment expereince. That's always a good thing.\n\nRather, I don't want you to become discouraged when you find that being intentionally present 24\/7 is actually pretty difficult, and takes intentional cultivation. I call the intentional cultivation bit 'meditation.'\n\nI hope that's helpful. If so, there are definitely 'easier' techniques that are specifically geared to 'daily life practice.'

A successful meditation practice will help you become aware that you are daydreaming, **in the moment you are doing it**. This is largely due to the cultivation of sensory clarity, one of the core mental skills meditation develops. Sensory clarity is your ability to discern one thing from the next, even when thoughts are fleeting, vague, or ambiguous. \n2. Being now aware that you are daydreaming, the next step is to decide on a new behavior. But which behavior? A successful practice will help you figure out what is most productive and relevant in the moment. How? Another of the core skills meditation develops is concentration. Concentration is the ability to hold in attention what you deem relevant. Once you can concentrate on the task and environment at hand longer and with more stability, you'll be able to more effectively and clearly reason about what to do.\n3. Once you know how you need to change, you'll very likely encounter negative emotions associated with changing. Here too, meditation will help you accept and be present with these negative emotions, giving you more space to act appropriately. The ability to allow all sensations to come and go without push and pull in this way is called 'equanimity.' It's the last of the three fundamental skills successful meditation develops.\n\nThe core delusion here, is that you can act in the future. You can't. You can only act in the present moment, and the future doesn't really exist except as a concept in your head. If you convince yourself that substituting the pleasant feelings of *planning to act* (read: fantasizing\/daydreaming) are a sufficient reward, then you never actually *will act* the one and only time you can (in that moment). Meditation will help you see when you are convinced\/influenced by this delusion. \n\nBy the way, I hope that last bit doesn't come across as harsh in any way. We are *ALL* caught out by this at some point - it's a *very* convincing delusion, and brains are weird about this stuff.

There is no reason to try to prove yourself to them (or any one) unless it truly aligns with your own goals for yourself. Mindfulness has definitely helped me figure out what my own goals are and helped me to let go of goals I was aiming towards for the sake of others and their expectations of me. That realisation has lifted a lot of weight from my shoulders. If you chose to go against what people expect of you I've found that actions speak louder than words, you don't need to defend your choices. Live your life your way and they will either respect you for it or (sadly) they wont. Remember you can't control other people, only your reaction to them and that works both ways."

Simply noticing sounds around you, approaching with a simple 'oh, that's interesting' and then returning to a focus point such as the breath is enough. It's the same with our thoughts and emotions, no matter what they are. And yes with OCD I can see it being very difficult, I can't speak from personal experience. But just like a sound that you can't control entering your ears, you have no control over these thoughts either. Instead of concentrating on them which amplifies your anxiety, simply approach these compulsive thoughts with that same attitude of curiosity. You have no control over them, so don't judge yourself for their occurrence. You are not these thoughts, you are the consciousness that is noticing that they are happening. And yes, they are going to keep arking up and looking for attention. And every time you notice you slip into paying attention to them, mentally chuckle, think oh silly me I got caught up again, and return to the feeling of the breath, of your feet on the floor and your bum in your seat. Don't judge yourself or feel like you've wasted a meditation session because you couldn't complete a body scan in fifteen minutes or what have you. This is a skill, and even if you only hit the net every time you serve, stepping out on the tennis court is one hundred percent more effective and one hundred percent going to lead to more gains than not trying at all.

"responses":[ "I really like ACT, but I’ve been seeing a therapist for a long time (who doesn’t apply it, but talks with me about it when I bring it up) and I am in a place where I am more open to the kind of change ACT can bring on than say, where I was a long time ago.  If you’re trying to just do it on your own, it can be challenging if you don’t have the support (like from a trained therapist) to help you move through obstacles or when the exposure increases your discomfort with the thoughts-emotions you’re struggling with.  It’s the looking at and working through the parts where it feels like it’s getting worse that a therapist is especially helpful. Sometimes it can get worse before it gets better (this phenomenon is addressed is behavioral therapy models too), which is usually when people stop and don’t continue. BUT don’t take that to mean you need to suffer through it, just that this is why working with a professional is very important.  \n\nIt can also be really helpful to start with small goals in the mindfulness practice before digging into the harder emotional stuff. One of the transformative concepts in ACT that the mindfulness training helps with is psychological flexibility—- a way of being in the present that allows you to hold on less tightly to thoughts and emotions in a given moment so you can be adaptive and act according the values you set for your life.  Essentially, not to live as though your thoughts and emotions are set in stone with absolute control over your behaviors, but ebb and flow.  \n\nMy explanation is poor (haven’t had my coffee yet), but i see that for any of that to be possible, you have to start with the basics of mindfulness and establish a plan for the discomfort that confronting your thoughts\/emotion this approach will bring about. Also, it’s totally ok if ACT or CBT aren’t the right fit for you.  Mindfulness apart from mental health models is wonderful on its own and likely can support any kind of therapeutic system. \n\nHope this helps (apologies for the book-length responses)! There are a lot of great really simple books on ACT and YouTube videos.  And there are more and more therapists\/counselors trained on ACT than ever before.  \n\nBest of luck to you!"

When we did end up discussing things, all she said was that I have a mental illness, and we can work on it, but never HOW to work on it. Acknowledging the issue has made my anxiety and depression more bearable, but it feels like I'm putting a band-aid on a broken bone, if that makes sense. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for your advice! I'll try to discuss this with my mom and see if I can see a new counselor. Along with that, my boyfriend has asked me if I'm interested in taking medication for depression or CBD oil for my anxiety. My fear with both of those is that they'll make my symptoms worse. I've heard of the bad side effects that can come with medication, and about a year ago I went to get a tooth pulled and was given some sort of drug, probably laughing gas, and my body felt so over relaxed that it gave me a panic attack.

It's okay to feel that way and it's never an insult to your family if you need help, it's insensitive of them to suggest that. Maybe they're just not great at empathy and don't know what to say.

I always rule out being bipolar because I take so many uppers (coke and addy) pretty regularly, and usually when I display signs if mania. I haven't been sober for so long that I honestly can't decipher the difference. I've been to multiple psychiatrist and therapist, I figured they would've diagnosed me properly. But maybe not. I've done a lot of research on both disorders. Because Google and self diagnosis are the way to go obviously. Lol I never considered that maybe I am experiencing episodes of mania, which then lead to me being hypersexual and doing drugs. Thanks for putting that into perspective. \n\nSince being in OK I've checked myself into a psych hospital once and attempted to start back on ability and celexa. But unfortunately since doing coke I stopped taking my meds. I completely agree that deciding to coke is a direct result of my mental health being out of whack. I realize that I enjoy the temporary feelings of euphoria and happiness. I know that I won't stop doing it until I get on some sort of meds to even out this chemical imbalance and remove myself from having access to it until I safely go through withdrawal. Which is why I considered checking back into a hospital for a couple of weeks. Thank you for the reminder to go easy on myself when it comes to doing it. But as you know it's a never ending cycle of beating myself up for doing it and rationalizing that it's okay it's just the depression causing it lol. I hate that the only time I feel okay is while in high on uppers. I almost went to the point of trying to get prescribed addy. Thank God I didn't.\n\nAs far as rock bottom, I agree to a point. I say I hit rock bottom because I reached the point of getting addicted to meth. That for me I probably the worst thing I've ever done. I was on it for about three weeks. It was the best high I've ever experienced next to dmt! I only stopped because I started experiencing psychosis with body tremors. Which lead my dumb ass to go to the Dr only to be completely embarrassed and judged and told that it's normal just wait it out. I was treated like any other junky which was a really shitty feeling. I see why people don't reach out for help. Anyways, since that incident I have touched it again but I secretly want to. I've been neglecting my financial responsibilities to buy coke and addy. I understand why you'd disagree that this is rock bottom but to me it is. The moment I decided to do meth and the after aftermath were rock bottom to me. The only thing I have going for me is the fact that I have an apartment and in employed. But does that really count if I'm not paying my rent and I'm having panic attacks at work that are causing me to leave. Thank God my managers are understanding but I shouldn't have a job rn. Shame on me for going to work so fucking high that I became overly paranoid that everyone knew I was high which caused the panic attack. \n\nI just don't wtf I'm doing with my life. I'm literally wasting it. Again, I know that it's due to this chemical imbalance but I can't refrain from taking some of the blame as just pure recklessness. IDK. I clearly need to contact a psychiatrist asap and get properly diagnosed and on medication. It's just really hard not having a vehicle, getting around to the places I need to go to get shit done. Noone wants to ask for a ride to the local mental facility. But I want to get help because bi fear that this nonchalant whatever happens happens attitude will lead me to do something stupid. \n\nSorry for the long post. I'm rambling thanks to addy.

    "responses":[ "Do you get on Youtube much? There's a guy there named CG Kid and he helped me so much in putting my drug use into perspective. His personality and non-judgy vibe is a fucking breath of fresh air too! I'm not sure if he still does it, but he used to offer text counselling\/coaching to people. May help? \n\nI missed the part about you doing meth initially. Be careful with that drug, it's the devil in disguise as your best friend. You'll eventually get used to being so high, that real life will bore the fuck out of you. Your brain chemistry will take a massive beating too. Im not judging you though, I think anyone in the right circumstances would get hooked on it. Since you're in the early phase, watch CG Kids take on meth, he will change your mind as he will tell you where it leads. Not just how good it feels at the beginning\n\nI think I initially came off as dismissive about you hitting rock bottom, sorry. I more meant that you've only lived like 30% of your life, so statistically it could still happen. I got caught up in the idea of rock bottom. When I thought I had reached it, I took it as comfort that it would never get that bad again. But then it fucking did. So the disappointment from that made me spiral even more. My intent was the steer your focus away from that, so you don't have expectations that can be broken in the future.\n\nDo you have a safety plan? Like, lets say right now you lost your home and your job. What would you do? Who can you call. Write that shit down, call up friends\/family and explain how things are and if you can rely on them in case of emergency. Then include them in the plan. Being vulnerable and asking for help is a sign of strength of character. If someone judges you for it, then they weren't really looking out for your best interests were they? If you come up with a plan now, it will help you take a logical and safe course of action if things go south. Depression has a way of taking away logic and rational behavior. Write down phone numbers of local charities and shelters, so you can have a backup backup plan. If you have pets, do you have anyone who could take care of them etc. Get this stuff out of the way now, so your mental resources can be dedicated to fixing a problem should it arise\n\nI gather you're in America? Do you have some kind of unemployment scheme for sick people? If so, look into the requirements for that. In my country I'm lucky enough to have had that safety net when I had a breakdown, resulting in me quitting my job and becoming housebound for a while. I really do hope your country has something similar. Having time to heal is so important and it pains me to hear you have to put rent above your mental health. I guess people do it alot in society anyway, but when you have a mental illness that could result in your death - the stakes get raised a bit. If you don't have a social security system that allows for sickness payments, are there charities that do? Perhaps you could volunteer there or something. Surely a first world country can look after its sick people right?? \n\nAs for the bipolar thing, don't let me put ideas into your head. It's just something to file away and keep in mind. I actually was in denial at first, when I got diagnosed. Depression seemed like a simpler label, so I was reluctant to let go. I didn't even look at bipolar symptoms, as I was scared if it confirmed my diagnosis. Boy did it smack me in the face when I did read them, I ticked every box. What Im trying to say is, we are biased as fuck and should never be trusted to put weight into a diagnosis. Let the psych do that. But, if you have suspicions and the psych dismisses them - you should possibly try someone else."

Meds don't help everyone but they can be a good place to start if the chemicals in your brain aren't functioning the best so you can do the things you need to do to get better.\n\nI still fall into my pit. I get suicidal and i get numb like you're describing. Im not sure if im the best person to answer this but I'll list some things that have helped decrease the amount of time i spend in my pit. For reference, i dropped out of college because i didn't know who to turn to for help and I'd spend 2 weeks lying on the floor of my apartment before my mind would let me leave. This was around 2013. Now days, i spend about 1 to 3 days in my pit before im able to crawl out and try to live life again. \n\n1. Reading. Mainly about stoicism, buddhism, meditation, cognitive behavioral therapy, and borderline personality disorder.\n\n2. Exercise. I prefer weights to cardio but try and do both. I am not that consistent and can go weeks without working out. \n\n3. Eating less sugar. When i get in my whole i don't want to cook so I'll go buy frozen meals and convenience shit like instant oatmeal and yogurt. Not the best but better than my preferred meals of doritos and sugar cookies. \n\n4. This one is big and this one is tough. Finding someone who will remind me of all these things when I'm in my pit and start lying to myself that I'm not making progress and I'm worthless. It's hard to do on your own but it can be done. More in 5.\n\n5. Journal. Good and bad. When you feel up go back and challenge the down thoughts. Prove to yourself that that the depression is a lying sack of shit in any way you can. For me, this helps subconsciously i think. When i drop, i will swear up and down that none of the above is true or worth it. I will find any and every thought the proves what i fuck up i am, but ive noticed that there's a small voice that's fighting back. \n\n6. Practice patience and kindness with yourself. Super hard as well but worth it. Im still learning this. I don't have tips for this one.\n\n7. Podcasts have helped me when no one is around. I know i have one person. One friend. Ive pushed everyone else away. I tried to push him away yesterday but he fights for me. However he can't be there all the time. Right now im binging new mindset, who dis by case kenny. Love it.\n\n8. Cannabis. It gives me panic attacks if i smoke too much. But the pros out weigh the cons for me. Out of all the anti depression and anti psychotics ive taken, it works the best for me. I want to try micro dosing lsd or shrooms in the future. Or to go on a therapeutic trip with a seasoned guide. \n\nThese are in no particular order. I am by no means an authority or cured in any way. I could drop into my pit tomorrow and swear to you that a car crash off the bridge is the way to go, but today, right now, my mind is settled and i realize that the slow and snail like progress ive made is working. \n\nI wish you the best and i hope you find some coping strategies that will work for you and your future self. Much love and sending hugs from the midwest.\n\nEdit: also wanted to say even a baby step is still a step. Just try and focus on one baby step at time. Try, hard for me, to focus on doing that one baby step until it's done."

Constantly try to distract yourself if you’re numb with anything emotional, such as music or films. Try to ensure your surroundings are pleasant for you; try to keep a somewhat tidy room and keep warm; And if you feel like you’re wasting your time, try to wake up earlier if you can. That feeling of success can propel you further.\n\nAs for the social side, you have a choice: Hide it or open up. As the latter is a harder path, hiding it will be the easier choice. I have a stepdad too, one who’s treated me like an enemy and a threat and tried to alienate me from my family. Luckily for me, that family is both large and trusts me more, and while I can’t be sure if you have the same situation, distancing yourself from your abusers is a good option.

I have changed my university subject 3 times and they were all private universities. I was still living with my mother. She never complained about anything but I felt like the same. Especially because my sister went to one of the best public university, she always found scholarship for her further education. I couldn't stop feeling like a failure and I was making it worse for my family.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt first, I was just thinking and feeling these but still had a happy face. After a while I started drinking alcohol a lot. At time I was just thinking as having fun but it was a call for help. I started arguing with my friends. After a while they stopped calling or texting me because I was a 'mood killer'. One night when I was out with my 'best friend' I got really drunk and we start arguing. She said 'You only have friends because I am your friend but I can't stand you anymore.' That was it. Being drunk and what has said I think without considering too much I took painkillers to get rid of my headache. It was more than I should take. A part of me had it enough I guess. I woke my mother up telling her I am not feeling very well. We went to ER.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter that night I realised that I needed to get help. I couldn't cope with this anymore. So I went to see a doctor. I am still on medication because she said I have repetitive depression and it is hard to know when I can have another depression attack. I feel so much better though. I stop talking to everyone who left me alone when I was vulnerable. I talked to my family and I was very upfront about it. They are really supportive. I was also scared that everyone will treat me differently and no one will want anything to do with me. But it wasn't like that. At first they were more understanding if I had problems but now everything is how it used to be but I have better friends, a partner that really supports me and a family that knows I am trying my best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI know that everyone's experience is different but I think you should get help. Your family will understand and support you. It is better to get that support than feeling that way. With friends and relationships you will find people who don't treat you like a sick child and who understands your problems. If people can't handle you at your worst they don't deserve to be with you at your best."

    "responses":[ "Depression can often distort our logical senses, making us panic and feel depressed out of habit, when in reality there is nothing wrong . I remember that in psychology , they explained that the brain activates a sense of pleasure ,like having an addiction, out of being sad.  I have as well dealt with depression my whole life and this can often impact how we deal with our sadness, where at some degree we  become addicted without noticing\/ unconsciously . After a long time we build a predisposition to see everything go wrong or bad, but to this you must rationalize and see the logistics  of the situation. I can understand that this may not be a quick process but try breathing exercises and think positively. Because at the end of the day you can go two ways, you can think negatively or positively and the path that can lead us to be more productive is staying in a positive note. \n\nNow l understand that is a lot different when people don't answer your calls, the world may start to take a negative aspect. Making us feel even worse from the current  situation that we are  already confronting.  But don try to jump to conclusions ( the mind can be very deceiving)  as I said before, trying to be positive can be productive along the way. I also understand your frustration when it come to other folks not helping .  But unfortunately many folks do no go out of their way to help bystanders.  Again in psychology  is call the bystander effect. But try to not center your attention on others , since these are factors that are out of control.  I can understand that it may be discouraging  to be alone. \n\nNow, you are not the only one that struggles with these thoughts. Many of us here do but its up to to us to to work towards our fears to enjoy our life once again. I had heard this quote from a game and its pretty inspirational: \" Struggle is an illusion. The only chains that bind you are the ones you accept\". It maybe be a long a painful journey but soon enough you will get there, small baby steps are better than none.  We believe in you and don't lose hope."

    "responses":[ "Hello friend. So let me give you my opinion on some things.\n\n> My mood constantly changes. \n\nI've been thinking about this for myself and friends and I think it's rather normal: If you feel depressed but are constantly trying to get better and function properly and push forward, it's normal to experience these ups and downs. (Now that I write this I realise I also have to mention: be careful if you are taking any medication that they are taken properly, otherwise they might cause these mood swings, obviously that's a different matter)\n\n> I don't know how to control it. \n\nI don't think it can be 100% controlled, you can control your actions for the most part though. No need to panic, find some things that calm you, maybe eat something (don't overeat), or maybe lie down for a little while and take some time to get back into the game. This is just me talking, and I'm not an expert. I think you might find other techniques, maybe it's worth looking online for some stuff.\n\n> Whenever I start feeling \"bad\"], whenever my mood goes down, I feel nothing. \n\nImo it's a coping mechanism; sometimes better to feel nothing than feel bad. It's a nice chance to think calmly.\n\n> Is there any way to battle this feeling? \n\nAgain I'm not an expert but as far as I know we can't pinpoint a solution to one specific thing, even if it's different for every person. But I think you'll find 3 things cover a lot of stuff:\n\n1) The everyday habits, especially work\/study and exercise. Exercise will make you feel better and while it may seem only treating a symptom don't uderestimate it. In the case of the depression, the symptom can also be a cause, it wouldn't be a vicious cycle otherwise. With work\/study there is no negotation, you need a reason to get out of bed no matter what, and hold yourself accountable.\n\n2) Talking (therapy): Either to help put some of your thoughts in order or even discuss philosophically about things that might be getting you down. It doesn't have to be a therapist, it can be friends and family, but (!) if you feel a therapist might help do not hesitate in any way.\n\n3) Medication: I guess it's just true our feelings depend on chemistry so it's not so bad to get a boost if needed. Always on advice of a medical professional of course.\n\n> Recently, my desire to selfharm has been on the rise, too. I started  selfharming more than a year ago and currently I WAS almost three weeks  clean. Was. I was beating my legs for a while. \n\nAgain I'll say it's to be expected wanting to self harm on some really bad days. But if you ask me, it's simply, wrong. It doesn't help anything, it only adds more problems. I won't even try to argue about this. Like, if I try I guess I can imagine some very few people with an extreme and rare mental condition may resort to this and may need serious help to stop. But I would assume this is not the case with you. Just don't do it. I don't know how else to say it. Hit a pillow or something. Not yourself.\n\n>  I do my hobbies almost everyday, I try my hardest to go outside and communicate with people \n\nThat's good. It might not be enough, actually it obviously is not. But that doesn't mean you're wrong by doing these things. You managed to not abandon your hobbies and not isolate yourself, that's actually really really important. Keep it up.\n\n> this feeling keeps coming back again and again. \n\nIt might disappear immediately. Or it might take some time. Don't give up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope some stuff I wrote were helpful. If not I'm sorry but feel free to reply to this if you want."

I'd thought I'd visit the subreddit today to try and repay the debt I feel I owe.

I was a wreck, it felt as if someone pulled a rug from under my life. My identity was gone, I couldn't write any more, couldn't play guitar, I had to quit my job, dumped from a long term relationship, I had to leave school due to depression and, had to move back with my emotionally abuse mother. It fucking sucked. I was absolutely miserable, angry and, stuck.\n\nI can't begin to imagine how debilitating Myotonia is. And I hate to compare something benign like tremors to it. But they grinded my life to a halt, just like yours, had to live in less than preferred conditions with less than ideal means.\n\nYou have to give yourself a chance to breathe. You haven't failed life, not even close. Imagine going through such terrible tribulations and coming out of it? That's not a story of failure that's one of success, great success. You'll come out of this so incredibly strong that every difficult situation following this will be a walk in the park.\n\nWhen home gets unbearable, take a step outside and go for a walk to get privacy and the time to collect your thoughts. Now, if it's too painful to walk around for too long try to find a nearby spot to get away from it all. Bring a book along (or something of the sort) to lose yourself in another world to distract from it all.\n\nDon't fret about losing your identity, you really didn't lose it. You only lost some part of it - the way you expressed it. Find the core of what that was and discover new ways to express yourself. But that's easier said than done as it probably was the hardest pill for me swallow. I loved playing guitar but couldn't anymore - the core of that was the love of music. So, I took up a few other music related hobbies to fill that void.\n\nYou said you felt defined by your academic standing, physical capabilities, family bond, and your unique job. What's at the center of each of those things?\n\n  \n\n\nNow, not having income and means of transportation sucks - no two ways about it. I'm not sure where you live but I was able to get social assistance which was a huge help. It's temporary help you get your feet back on the ground. After I was able to receive social assistance I got a cheap place renting with two other roommates. It was more comfortable than living back home with my mother and two months after moving out I got a do-able job considering my condition. And public transportation, although it's not as nice as using your own car, gets you where you need to go.\n\nOh boy I wrote a lot I do have more to say but it's getting late and I'm a slow typer nowadays. If you need advice, help, or someone to talk to feel free to PM me - using a throwaway but I'll be sure to be on the lookout this week."

I'm financing my therapy out of pocket with student loans (as part of my living expenses) and making progress for the first time.\n\nInsurance would never pay and this is the only way I could make it work.\n\nI honestly don't know how people do it but like I said it took me 10 years of severe suffering to finally get it set up for I could get the help I needed and in the meantime I lost everything including my family, my friends, my boyfriend...I wasted time on medications that made me gain hundreds of pounds and didn't work at all...\n\nI hope you can find a way soon...Think about going back to school (possibly online) so that you can be available during the day when therapists have their therapy sessions. That's the only thing that worked for me and then you can finance it with some of your student loans as your living expenses.\n\nIf you find another way to make it work-please let us know so that others can be helped and our community of support can continue to foster!\n\nKnow that we are here for you and all care and believe very much in what you are going through currently.\n\nGood luck!"

I often say that we're our own guinea pigs. When it comes to any kind of medication designed for psychiatric use, it's not unusual to have to keep trying different types and dosages. You *shouldn't* have to feel that way--and the meds are designed to help. But, if you're on the wrong type and\/or dosage, they don't. I strongly recommend that you go back to your provider.

I have a different perspective to offer on this I think. \n\nI believe a more productive way to think about therapy than \"no pain no gain\" might be more like a lock and key situation. There are a bunch of variables on the side of the client (whats happened, whats happening, etc), and there are a bunch of variables on the side of the therapist (how they work, what they believe, what their training is, what their individual skillset is). \n\nThere are lots of different models of therapy. These models sit on philosophical frameworks which are also quite diverse. Each therapist has their own (thinking about therapy, or philosophy) and (frameworks they are skilled in). Getting back to the lock and key, the matter of whether therapy is likely to work for a client is to some extent a feature of what models the therapist is using. Its also well known that there are factors that can negate the extent to which models affect quality of therapy and these are relationship-based. In other words, if the therapist and client personally 'click' this may be a significant driving factor in how well therapy 'works'. Its relational to some extent. \n\nGetting back to the models, one way of thinking of them is two schools of thought. (1) Depth psychology, which is about what happened, what meaning was made of what happened, and how the person responded or reacted to what happened. It may also consider a lot of the persons experience to be the result of subconscious or 'deep' thinking. (2) forward facing models, which are concerned with what is happening NOW, what meanings people are making of things in the present, how well that current stuff is working, and what can be done to improve it. \n\nYou may be able to see from this that (1) is more likely to require clients and therapists to engage in \"no pain no gain\" thinking, and (2) may not require it. That is not to say that (2) might not involve some discomfort - by challenging current conceptions of how to manage things - but the way the two approaches (that we are using for the sake of argument) is probably distinguishable this way. And thats kind of important for clients to know. Unfortunately, going into therapy, most dont, and they get stuck with whatever therapist and whatever model is their particular preference. This can be unhelpful for some clients. I believe practiced unskillfully, it can certainly be harmful. (I dont want to get into that too much here because this post is getting pretty long). \n\nI think the best thing to do is figure out whether you want to be talking a lot about your past - and if you feel that would work for you based on what you know from your experience so far - or if you would find it more useful to be talking about wehats happening now, and where things are heading from here. If unsure, it might be worth trying a different therapist and model to learn more about what fits best for you."

You'll get a lot more participants and data if there were, say, 25 questions.\n\nMany mental health testing sheets have approximately 20-30 questions regarding sleep, frequency of depression, etc. All these questions are based on a 1-4 scale, low to high. Take inspiration from there to hone in on suicidal behavior.\n\nI wish you the best, but please fix your survey."

(Nothing wrong with that, btw.) When I was in my teens\/early 20's, I was a mess, and I wasn't even depressed most of that time. Honestly, those age ranges just suck, period, and having any kind of issue like anxiety, depression, etc. would make it a lot tougher.

And, I'm beginning to suspect that NOBODY has the definitive benchmark for being happy and fulfilled.  Absolutely nobody. I think \"filled\" has to be defined by the individual, just like being \"empty\" does.  \n\nYou sound rather young, because of the statement about staying with your family on vacation. (Nothing wrong with that, btw.) When I was in my teens\/early 20's, I was a mess, and I wasn't even depressed most of that time. Honestly, those age ranges just suck, period, and having any kind of issue like anxiety, depression, etc. would make it a lot tougher.  If I could talk to my much (!) younger self, I'd tell her that it DOES get better.  And, I say the same thing to you.  What you're going through right now is really tough. But, the good thing is, it's not forever.  That may not be especially helpful in the short term, particularly when you're immersed in your situation. But it's important for that little part of your brain that still tunes in to know!   \n\nOne thing that keeps me going, day after day, is my absolutely favorite quote:  \"It will all be OK in the end. If it's not OK, it's not the end.\" Living as a human being is really, really hard. Hang in there."],

I just thought maybe if I just be passive to her, then I won't get treated like a punching bag as much. Didn't help and got a bit worse. I kinda had to pull a trick that people do to wild animals, show you are no threat. I just laid my self out emotionally till she tired out, kinda cried many nights and cry really even cry anymore, but I was kinda worth it.\n\n\nI think it is okay too, to an extent. She takes it too far. Like I thought she wasn't that bad, but as the years passed, she kinda started getting bad. She did go through the loss of a close friend which she didn't share to me, but she just constantly made me feel shitty. Then I would got through a very close uncle and grandma while she didn't even come to the funeral. Her dad did, but she was no where to be seen. I just feel like I constantly try to help her  by getting closer while she pushes away.\n\n\nShe isn't too much any more, like she is just slightly immature to the whole thing. She is just remorseless now.\n\nAlso yeah this is why I want to try to mend this."

It lies to you about how you should be feeling, about your self-worth, and often makes you want to pull away from everything and everyone. Depression lies and manipulates you into not wanting the help that will make you feel better.  Every time I help myself, every day I make it to the end of, I WIN.  You are not acting up or being lazy. Depression is a neurochemical state, not a choice. Remember, depression gaslights you into believing all sorts of crap! Choosing to  do something that helps yourself, even if you don't feel like it will, is a step towards winning the war."

(It always makes me laugh.) He never treated me like I was broken, but always showed me he cared and that I had a friend.\n\n2.) I was at University (several years later), it was around spring break in my junior year, when I hit a bad episode. My brother (a freshman in a university on the opposite side of the state) turned down a trip to the beach with his friends, because he knew I needed him. (During that week he did the thing from the first memory whenever I got depressed.)\n\nI've done similar things for like that for him, we've always just had each others back. I could on forever about the times he's helped me out of the dark. \n\nParents are great, but there is something different about having your brother\/sister be there for you. My brother never treated me different. I knew he was there for me not because he felt sorry for me, but because he loved me and we were brothers, and that hadn't and wouldn't change.\n\nHonestly, whenever I hit a depressive episode, there isn't anyone I'd rather have in my corner."

    "responses":[ "Well, I didn't have enough grades to make it to uni right after high school. Even tho, my parents wanted me to be a medical doctor, since they were both medical doctors. I didn't really have a dream job of my own, although I did say I want to be a psychiatrist since I hated needles, and that seemed like the only job in medicine that wouldn't need needles.\n\nI also didn't live with my parents since elementary - they were back in my home country. Which didn't help relationship with my parents either. Since, we had so much differences from being seperated.\n\nSo, surprise surprise, when their child at the end of high school, didn't even have enough grades to go to college, let alone intention to pursue medicine. I've been constantly thinking about suicide during high school, and it seemed like worrying about my future at all is a pointless endeavor. Although, I never self harmed or attempted suicide. So, I literally lived the moment, except instead of a party and all that jazz, it was just sleep and food that attended my life.\n\nIn order to avoid being a high school graduatem and to avoid my conscription - biggest reason why hikkikomori isn't as big problem in my country as Japan - back in my home country. I started attending an animation school, for a diploma. It was occupying few floors on a small building in the middle of Auckland city. My parents thought this was the worst school they ever seen. My mother literally cried at how shit it was. But, as Asian parents they gave me funds to study animation anyway.\n\nWhile studying computer animation - so like 3d animation, like 3ds max, (and watching Japanese animation) I played a lot of MMORPGs, one of them gave me a chance to be a Game Master at a private server with about 900 concurrent users at any given time. Between that and watching how Avatar was made in short documentary youtube videos, which predicted animator as a job is a dying field since it will be replaced by computer programs who can make computer animation for them. Anyway, the game master thing was an eye opener for me, since I never knew how much I would enjoy other people enjoying what I think would enjoy.\n\nSo, after finishing (barely - because my first year instructor hated my guts, second year instructor was a grumpy old man, and maybe a little bit racist, while my third year instructor was a dick - and I hope he dies in a slow and painful manner.) So, I would just stay in my room, and not go to class, and attendance rate was a thing) animation, I went back to my home country for conscription.\n\nMy time in the army wasn't that bad. The month long bootcamp was fun enough, altho I would not do it ever again. Instead of going in to army directly, I went to civil service, so I was working along with government officials in a local community center. If the pay wasn't shit - which is below minimum wage since it's conscription, I would have loved to work like that for the rest of my life because I nearly didn't need to do anything. Once in a while, I would help other government officials move some boxes, send posts, and deliver confidential documents. But, mostly I played flash games on the work computers. When they later blocked it. I just started using proxy web services or https. The most serious thing I was most called for was IT or Translation, which wasn't a lot. Since, one of my government official didn't even know what Windows was, I was the only guy with computer related knowledge.\n\nAnyway, during the two years, my parents wanted me to at least have a college degree. So they tried to put me up to get in to a college. Which required my high school records, except New Zealand high school I attended told me they don't have a record of me. So, basically I didn't even graduate high school. So, I had to take a GED. Eventually I managed to enter an university in US. Which was okay at first. Since, everything was metaphorically new and shiny to me. I went to a school psychologist my first year there. Who I convinced to see the school psychiatrist. Who told me he thought I am having depressive episodes but he didn't think I had depression yet on first few diagnosis. Eventually, I lost interest in education, so my grades slipped. Went from 3.8 on my first semester to failing academic standard by third semester. So, eventually school said come back when you feel like studying and academically dismissed me. I went to a community school after that, but for me, this was worse than my animation school in New Zealand. There were metal detectors, and clogged toilets everywhere. Literal shit school if you ask me. Anyway, I stopped attending there altogether too. I think I went to the community school a dozen times during that semester, and half of that was to hand in applications, before finally deciding education isn't right for me, at the end of that semester.\n\nUnfortunately, my parents didn't agree that I wanted to drop out. They would constantly berate about how technically, I didn't even graduate from high school since my New Zealand high school didn't recognize me as a graduate, and that GED doesn't count. It wasn't like I could live seperately from them with no income. Especially as an Asian, where independence from family doesn't come automatically when you are 18 like in America.\n\nSo, after about 6 month, I sent in a request for readmission at my first university, whom they accepted. Soon enough depression came down hard again so I would just stay in my room, and not do anything. So, I went to the psychiatrist in US again. Despite my parents telling me not to go seek a psychiatrist - since according to them they will use me for their \"experiements\". I kept getting told by a whole lot of people that maybe I didn't make the cut to be studying the major I chose, so I finally caved in and I tried changing that too. But, nope. I guess that wasn't it either. Because I lost interest in everything all over again. So, I am a college drop out right now. With no job, no employment history, no training whatsoever.\n\nThe school psychiatrist in US would give me medication, but I couldn't book them before the meds ran out. Once it ran out, for me, I fell harder because I was higher up. It was like having an allergy your whole life, then took the cure for it, but then when your allergy returns, you suddenly can't breathe. Since, you are not used to having clogged breathways any longer. Well, that's how I would describe my experience with the medication. Also, it taking a few weeks to see any serious effect and is not a immediate happy pill didn't help return immediately to a more normal life.  Few weeks to see the psychiatrist+ few weeks to start the med effect back up = months of depression autopiloting my life, where I just get back to my oldself.\n\nAt least when I went to see a psychiatrist back in my home country last year, they took my experience in US for it, and I didn't have to make lengthy series of apppointment to  convince them I had depression."

I'm not sure what I can tell you to make you feel any better at all. I've heard the pointless rants about how beautiful I am but they're just mere words when I dont believe them myself. I've been left alot in my life by family,friends and boyfriends. Almost everyone I put trust in broke my heart. It sucks,feeling lonely sucks,feeling not good enough,pretty enough,smart enough....it all sucks!! The only thing I can say is that you're not alone. Even when you think you're the only one on the planet feeling the way you do trust me when I say that you absolutely are not!!! We've all been there especially in our teens and sometimes even in our later years we still have those feelings... I feel them every now and again even today but after all those years of feeling worthless I've begun to say screw it,if they dont like what they see then they dont need to gawk at me anyway. I promise you that one day all this will pass and you will one day look back and see how truly lucky you are to be you. One day maybe you will be giving advice to someone like yourself and helping them cope. I'm not sure if this helped you at all but all I can do is tell you from my own personal experience and hope I could relate to you...best of luck and remember...it'll b ok"

Worse, they're dragging you down and making everything harder.\n\nYour hard work doesn't mean nothing - it's for *you* and that's important. It's for your future, so someday when you've pieced together a support group and a family of friends you can look back and laugh wryly saying \"Well that was a bit rough!\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are alone - in so far as *everyone* is alone. You're just learning this lesson a bit sooner than most people do due to your family circumstances. It's painful, it's sad. At the end of the day the only person who will *always* be with you and have your back is yourself - but that can be a wonderful thing as well. You can learn to be your own best friend - which is pretty nice, having someone always with you that has your own back y'know?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou're going to get through this, and be amazed at how strong you are. At how you can push through all this bullshit and come out the other side. You will grow stronger, and you will get through this.\n\nI don't know what you fought about with your step dad - but don't let his mental illness infringe on your mental health. Shore up your boundaries - cut yourself off if you need to. Is he a valuable addition to your life? Do you really need him in it?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI promise you, eventually you will find people who will be more family to you than the one you have experienced so far. Just keep putting one foot in front of another and work towards what *you* want from this life. You may have to go through life alone, but you're not alone in your experiences. There will be people who act as stars in the night sky to help you navigate along your way. You'll find moments of bonding with people that take your breath away - in a non-romantic sense - and find bonds that are stronger than the ones of family could ever be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne breath at a time, one foot at a time - you got this. You're working towards a brighter and happier future for yourself, and there will be people there to help you along the way. You just gotta' keep reaching out like you did here.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce again, you're doing so well. I'm really proud of you stranger."

I can't get a job at walmart because of the assessment but alot of idiots pass somehow. But I can help people through trauma and help them make psychological shifts that change their lives. That's just one example. I was shit at school and ended up dropping out of college despite an ability to learn subjects at an accelerated pace. I spent the first 20+ years of my life try to figure out why the fuck nothing worked. I had social anxiety that crippled me up until I was about 21. My relationship were terrible as well. All of these issues stemed from seemingly unrelated issues. Im going to say right now that there is no product you can really buy to fix your problems, but I'll give you some places to start. \n I started my real self improvement journey using things like state control,meditation and hypnosis. 1 of which is a part of my practice and another coming soon. Check out David Snyder on youtube.   For the instruction on state control and maybe try some hypnosis audio. \nBack to the story. I found some lectures on nlp a long time ago and ended up doing the state control exercises. Mainly because I would keep putting myself out there and just couldn't feel it and really put my best foot forward. I started tricking my mind and putting myself in a good mood for no reason. As I started doing this on a regular basis these feelings became my dominant emotions.  I noticed as I was able to feel it I was able to live it. People saw me differently as I became more outgoing. I didn't get the best jobs Immediately but my employers saw me differently  and my success rate in interviews went up. And I'm not making any promises but I was getting more dates and getting more friends. \nIn conclusion I would study nlp,state control ,and do some meditating or hypnosis.  \nI do not benefits from this guy's success but I will recommend him to you go to youtube and search david snyder nlp. If you have any questions pm and I'll clarify things for you and help you on your journey . I'd love to chat and help you anyway that i can. There's just too much damn pain in the world."

    "responses":[ "Aah, I feel like I may be able to help you with this one. I'm not 14 anymore but I went through a pretty similar problem at your age. I would always want to smoke or drink because it was the only way I could hold a conversation with people without feeling so awkward and full of anxiety. It was a really tough part of my life looking back (high school is a bitch)\n\nI think the turning point for me was one time when I just went all out and did waaay too much weed. I don't think one can actually overdose, but i genuinely think that that one time I did. It really messed me up, permanently.\n\nAfter that I was scared for weeks about what had happened and what I was supposed to do. Looking back now I basically accidentally scared myself out of it. I was only awake for about 3 hours after the high kicked in and it was easily the longest 3 hours of my life. I couldn't walk, I could barely speak, I really just wanted to cry, honestly it was super shitty!\n\nAfter that I concluded that it really wasn't for me. While most of my friends smoked, none of them did it habitually, and the ones that didn't smoke really shamed me when I brought up that I had done it before.\n\nSo I would say what got me off of it personally was that one time that was very traumatic, my friends not approving of it, my sister quitting it, and a lot of self evaluation.\n\nI'm not saying you should go and smoke a fuck ton and mess yourself up, please do not do that. I would say just talk to your friends about it, and try to bring about the topic lightly. If they're not part of your stoner group, ask them what their opinion is on weed and drinking. Maybe reach out to siblings you have as well and ask them what they think about it. I know it's hard to be direct about these sorts of topics of people as it's not something that can just pop up out of the blue usually.\n\nYou won't quit immediately though. I first told myself \"oh only with friends\" and then it escalated from there. Maybe start with \"I'll only do it at parties\" or things like that. Don't just try to cut yourself off, but rather limit yourself just a bit to start with. That one traumatic time I did it happened almost 2 years before I quit for good, but after that I did it at max once every other month. I don't think it would take everyone that long, everyone is different, but that's okay.\n\nAnd one more thing, I know a lot of this is based on social stigma for me personally. When I would have friends over and chose to stay sober, they got really upset with me. They would constantly try to pressure me into smoking, and I just wasn't comfortable doing that in my own home. After that night where I basically hosted like 5 high and drunk friends while sober, and still had a fun time, I think that's when one of the things clicked that I was genuinely happier without it. \n\nPlease don't let others pressure you into it though. I know it's very difficult, I was in your position and I couldn't do it, but try your best! Give excuses, lie, avoid them, do whatever you think it takes to avoid doing that shit man. (this is all assuming that a part of you wanting to do this comes from social stigma. If it doesn't then feel free to ignore.)\n\nIf you wanna talk more and clarify or have anything to say I'd be happy to hear it."

Each session are different topics and depending how i feel or if the psychiatrist see any improvements or not he chooses the dosis based on that. Also he gives personal tasks to do to improve your lifestyle. Ofc the tasks depending on how you feel are sometimes demanding, but is something that is gonna be useful on the longtime, not instantly.

You have got to realise that having social anxiety prevents you from doing things, it doesn't make them physically impossible, but to overcome the anxiety in a situation like that would take a lot of sacrifice and could have severe effects on your anxiety after that, so not being able to overcome your anxiety is not your fault, it was built into you and nothing could be done about it. If you had a 2 broken legs and were asked to run 100m, technically you could do it but realistically, you cant. You should see that a mental illness, such as social anxiety, is no different than a physical illness or injury, and you wouldn't blame yourself for not being able to run 100m with broken legs would you? So why should you for this situation. Also its not about the action that matters, its the thought, and you wanted to help, even though you may not have spoken out, which you couldn't of due to your situation, you wanted to and that's the best anyone could've done in your situation. \n\nI know you may feel like you watched these acts happen and did nothing about it to help, therefore it is your fault, but that's realistically not true. You weren't the root of the problem, therefore even if somehow you overcame your social anxiety which is very very rare and not many people can do, it wouldn't of changed much as you weren't the root of the problem, you can't change the way your father acted, that's down to him. Also try and put anyone else in that situation, with the levels of social anxiety you had and also your verbal levels, no one could've done better than you did. People blame themselves for things happening all the time as they did not interfere, yet they fail to realise that interfering doesn't change the root of the problem and can actually make it worse sometimes, so don't blame yourself for not being able to speak, you yourself know there's nothing you could do about it, and that speaking wouldn't of changed your fathers acts. Sometimes there are things in life that we can simply not help, feeling helpless is common, however you should never feel like you're the blame, and deep down you know that your'e not."

Making your own sweets is a great way to know what you are consuming, but unfortunately I can't advise you on how to stop completely, I am myself not able to hah.\n\nWhat triggered me in trying to find new ways was the fact my medicine was not effective anymore and I didn't like the prospect of trying a new one and only knowing after a few months if it worked. \n\nI've had intestinal problems getting used to the Dutch culture (short lunches and lots of bread) and realized it was the same feeling as back then. When taking an anti-inflammatory for other issues (physical) I've noticed I had a few good days afterwards. As you mentioned, after reading about gut flora and all, it was a quick and easy decision to try to help it. My breakfast is a bowl of a fiber source, yoghurt or milk and a fruit\/honey or jam to change it up a bit. Like you, I also have my slip up days\/weeks and fail to follow my rules, but the 'trick' I use is just accept the slip up and get back at it again. Also, having a heavier lunch and earlier lighter dinner helped a lot too.\n\nBack to the physical part, I'd been using ill fitted shoes for a season, making my right foot cramp up. Resulting in imbalanced walking. Other sport related injuries added to the imbalance of my hips and neck. I had pains and issues literally from my head to toes. Physiotherapy and yoga helped me target those areas and although I'm not completely fit or in shape, I do not longer feel 15 years older my age.  \nIt's also a long and slow process, as you have to bring everything back to 0 and start building it up again but I can now fall asleep in under 10 mins and stay asleep for 5+ hours without any extra meds! (those were nasty).\n\nTherapy sessions are not a huge mind tangle anymore and I feel as I have only one thing left to work out why it's keeping me from growing out of this hole. I've now been a week without taking my meds (own decision, I do not advise on stopping them yourself), it was a move made out of anger and not well thought out, without my therapist\/doc knowing, in short a dumb move but it felt as the right one (I think I'm quite alright at listening to my body). It payed off greatly for me as most outcomes so far are positives, the positive effects of the medicine were no longer there but the negative ones were. I am keeping track of my thoughts and feelings and will discuss it with my therapist next session, to make sure it's not just a periodic thing.\n\nThis is all simplified but in general what happened in my situation; many issues snowballed into a huge hole I am now slowly crawling out of. \n\nTLDR; What I'm trying to say is: pace and patience are key, slow and steady wins the race (even though I lack those in my bad days). Fix the little things you can, so you can free up resources to help with the bigger ones.  \n\n\nI'm always up for a chat or discussion if you or anyone else is willing to, hit me up!"

Visit different therapists until you find one that you like and trust. They can help you learn coping skills and new though processes as well as figure out what the root of the depression is. If it is a chemical imbalance, finding a psychiatrist to talk about medication with might also be helpful. Also, having friends or family members who are willing to be with you and help you figure out what's going on is helpful. I hope you find someone who can help you. \n\nDepression is a liar.

They notice the patterns that are developing that I can't see, or they know techniques of coping that are more effective than the methods that I have been using. You have to find someone who you feel comfortable with and that's a personality thing, I've had psychologists that I've clicked with instantly and ones who I saw once and walked out knowing that I would never see that person again. \n\nOne tip that worked for me, may work for you, I found psychologists who worked with CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy) work best for me when it comes to building new mental pathways to deal with everything. It works best if you fully commit to really trying both in sessions and following through with the techniques afterwards on your own. It's a personal choice of figuring out what works for you, do some research, look at therapists who are local to you, if it feels right or it's something that you genuinely want to explore that option I would try it."

Sure it would be great if you'd like to comment on some other post but this one was about you only. Then again if you insist, post a funny cat video and I'll consider your debt paid :D And I promise if I post and am in need of advice\/support I'll let you know in case you can help.\n\n2 - Yeah sure, I was just genuinely curious in what way. The way I have it in my mind one would go into the hospital if you're undergoing a crisis and you have to change environment and get proper treatment with relaxants and such. And maybe some more intensive talking therapy. You're saying the latter is what you're mostly after ok. Is it perhaps possible to ask to meet your therapist more often instead? I don't know, just saying if you thought about it. Or maybe the particular therapist isn't helping? The last one I had was pretty much useless, after 2 sessions once per week was already too much.\n\n3 - Gotcha\n\n4 - Awesome\n\n5 - I'm glad you can also see the other side of this.\n\nYou know what, I've been thinking a lot about what you said about being undeserving, and how to approach this based on what you've been saying. I think the most compelling argument I would like to make would be: I think you're plain wrong here. Like, sure, I don't know you, and maybe I could possibly imagine why you would think you're not the ideal child based on some standards (I'm not saying you're not, I'm just saying I could imagine a possible such scenario) but I would go ahead and guess I don't think there's any way you actually don't deserve your mother fighting for you. Hopefully you agree with me on this. If not ok, no harm done. If yes, well no one's perfect. You're young, still in uni, and you had depression to struggle with, you're still learning for fuck's sake.\n\nRegarding sharing thoughts wth your mother, you know the circumstances best, I'll leave it at that.\n\n6 - Ok I see. I think it's a bit of a long discussion, that of labels. Getting a diagnosis is extremely useful but it doesn't make it any more real than we make it.

Idk the science behind it but I've been told to use that before. I pretty much forget the rest, sorry. But I encourage you to do research on grounding techniques and such. \n\nAlso, a lot of therapists charge on sliding scales, basically giving discounts to people who don't have a lot of money. I saw one for 20$ an hour once. Idk if that's too much for you. But if you have health insurance, if I were u, I'd call the number on your insurance card, explain to them you need mental health services but are on a budget, and they may be able to help you out."

Occasionally I’ll pull up a “list of questions to ask yourself” in Pinterest and pick one to write about, but I find just getting my thoughts out of my head is the most helpful. If you write anything negative about yourself, scratch it out and write something positive to help shift your mindset.

I recently had aripiprazole added to my regimen and I am slowing and hopefully stopping benzos but this is just because my anxiety is greatly reduced and I want to take the least medication possible, not because I have had any ill effects from benzos.

The aripiprazole is not sedating to me at all and definitely not like quetiapine. I took 50mg of quetiapine one night (25mg normally) and I was a zombie until about 1400 the next day.

The common antidepressant classes are not addictive (i.e. typically do not tend to cause withdrawal symptoms) but all require slow weaning to prevent relapse of symptoms. The most commonly-prescribed first-line antidepressants (SSRIs such as fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram) have few serious side-effects compared with other classes that were more popular first-line treatments in the past, but again: no such thing as a drug without side-effects."

If that is the case, you need to seek medical help.\n\nIn terms of the loneliness - I understand, but even though it seems endless, high school will pass. I connected with very few people at high school (or secondary school where I’m from), and part of the problem is that you’re lumped together in classes with people with whom you may have nothing in common; you don’t get to choose the people you’re stuck with most of the time. This changes somewhat after high school - it’s easier to choose your companions at, say, university, and on top of that the majority of people are less mean - you obviously still get some cruel people, but the outside world isn’t the same as the vipers’ nest that is high school.\n\nIn the meantime - while you might be struggling to make friends at school, how about outside school? What do you enjoy - sport? Film? Photography? Walking outdoors? Board games? Reading? Art? Cycling? There may well be societies for some\/all of these things near where you live, and the internet will be able to tell you for certain. Even if you can’t think of anything you’re into that would have a society, you could always consider taking up one of those things as a new hobby and meeting people that way. You may even find a girlfriend this way, if that’s what you’d like. :)\n\nGood luck with it - I was also bullied quite badly for a period in secondary school, and I can’t tell you how much easier life can become in terms of making friends and enjoying life, once you’re able to choose your own.

It's hard to explain that nothing is wrong, and you still feel horrible which is why you're saying it's a problem.  \n\n\nI'd suggest looking into how to see a psychologist or psychiatrist in your area to get checked out, I'd also suggest trying to gather some youtube videos or reddit posts that seem to resonate with you. It can be hard to explain on your own, so I found finding other sources that helped put things into words was very helpful for me for explaining to others.  \n\n\nWhat I liked about seeing a professional was that they were removed from my social circle, so when I was being honest about some of the fucked up thoughts I was having, it stayed between them and me if that's what I wanted.  \n\n\nI was miserable most of my life even though technically things around me were good, and even today it's hard to explain to some people that I was still depressed because none of that stuff matters for my clinical depression. It wasn't about how great people were to me, or the opportunities I had. I'm on medication now and I finally don't feel miserable all the time for no reason. I'm not saying that'll be the route you take, but I'm definitely glad I got seen because all the well meaning people in my life could not help me, and they (and also myself actually) couldn't understand how something external was not the problem.  \n\n\nI'm not saying your family won't be supportive, but there can be a big communication gap with this stuff."

They can be the light on a dark day, make you laugh even as you cry, but in the end, they will never fill that void. I know it sounds cheezy, but it really really comes from within. and I know, it sounds easier and harder than ever, but it's true and different for each person.\n\n The only way I explain, is for me, I had everything. I had an apartment, I was working on a social media startup as head of marketing, dating the ceo, at 19 after dropping out of college mind you, everything I always thoguht I wanted. And every day, every second, the feeling of panic, empty, aching, panic, grew. I just knew I had to RUN. And after FOUR years, I did. I moved cities, was crashing in a friends spare room, fixing phones and striping on the side just to pay for my meds. It was hard, I missed him, I missed the people, but I never missed the life. In fact, I was happy-ish. I used my phone repair job to talk my way into consulting on an episode of Mr.Mercedes and worked with BRENDAN GLEESON. I realized through my striping job that I was a goth badass whos' scars from picking didnt matter. I found my confidence. In life and body. It took going from the \"best\" to the \"worst\" to realize that is ALL personal. The only happiness comes from satisfaction of self.\n\nI tried to make myself happy through doing what \"should be\". It wasn't until I stopped  trying to fill the hole with The perfect guy, the perfect life, The perfect job,  and just WAS, for a while. on my own, with no expectations beyond feeding myself and my dog, just existing, that I found myself. That was when I realized I am most content with malcontent. I love living life on my toes, reacting, bantering, getting that sale, landing that dance. Everything I was told would be wrong, was right. \n\nand yes, I realize I kinda branched from dating, but the concept still applies. I would bet money I dont have that many ppl have tried to fill that hole with many different things (I mean, addiction and depression are a problem for a reason) but, as hard as it is, you have to reach around that hole, and find yourself. I was taught to list my interests, from most important to least, by a doc, You read the list and use it to remind yourself there's different ways to define yourself beyond \"has guy\" or \"is depressed\" or \"cries\" and move to \"can recite the entire 22 year plot of One Piece by heart\" or \"can dismantle an iphone 6 blindfolded in 4 minutes\". Remind you what makes YOU. \n\nI've dragged on WAY too much. Anywho, friend, feel free to pm me, I'll talk, shoot the shit, listen to rants, lend a shoulder to cry, anything. I'm pretty lonely right now, myself, so I'm reachable any time. Just ask :) \n\nI hope this isnt too much of a novel D:"

In this case, from being in a similar position to your friend, the best way you can be supportive is continue with your \"normal\" friendship.  The thing we hate most is being labelled a \"survivor\"; because what we want most is to be \"normal\" like everyone else.\n\nTraumatic events from childhood do not put your friend in any immediate danger, so not speaking out is not personally harmful.\n\nLast year I found out I have PTSD from my childhood.  I started seeing a therapist and during my intake appointment, my childhood came up.  Having to retell some of the stories was really, really hard.  For a few days after that intake appointment, the memories would surface uncontrollably and I once cried publicly.  The therapist also confirmed it wasn't necessary to talk about that trauma to help me with the behaviors I originally came to solve.  Sometimes there is no meaning to be found in reliving life experiences that only bring pain.\n\nA lot of times, the most helpful thing you can do in a friendship, or any relationship, is just listen.  You've acknowledged to your friend that you're there for them.  But there's nothing more you can or should do.  Listening and not losing your calmness and giving a sense of normalcy is what support is.  You're a good friend for being supportive.  The only other thing I can tell you is you might want to see a therapist yourself to get a medical professional's advice about how you can best help your friend.  I hope this helps!"

Throughout high school I did have depression and anxiety but I didn't know I had it, therefore throughout high school I had poor grades, poor enough that I actually ended up graduating with a 1.7 gpa and no awards, no recognitions, no nothing, and then I failed my first year of college. Throughout this entire time my family as well was disappointed in me, I was quite literally a loser, bad grades, no friends, no SO, nothing. it wasn't until I was 18 that I met people I could really call friends, which is honestly all I had for a while. I had a SO during my first year of college, and because she made me happy, I feared my depression would return so I fear her leaving every day, then I find out I'm moving to another state, which them meant id either have to make long distance work or end the relationship, then came the news that I was failing my classes, and soon after my gf and I broke up for other reasons, ironically that day I was going to tell her I was moving, but I was shook by the breakup that nothing else came to mind, my final grades came in and I failed three of five classes, so here I am hanging on by a strand, with nothing left. I decided that now that I had nothing, I was going to use this move to make something out of myself, so I picked up new habits, got rid of old habits, and those friends I met at 18 years old, we're all still really close even after I moved, they still talk to me and some have even come visit me, them my grades made a huge improvement when I started at the new school, and now I'm a year away from graduating college with a 3.0 gpa. I understand that things are hard for you right now, but if I, some kid from nowhere who was the definition of a loser, could turn his life around, I believe anyone can, after all, we are still alive so theres still time to turn things around"

Like no one cared. I had no support from my family and was too embarrassed to seek help from friends.  After all they too were going through their fair share of problems.  I didn't want to take my life but I also didn't want to live.  I contemplated the idea and really thought about how everything would change.  Would I really be better off?  Did I truly give life a shot?  Perhaps it was a blessing in disguise but the idea came to mind that I could at the very least \"TRY\" to ask for help because a small piece of me still wanted to be here.  After all I had nothing more to lose at this point. So I went to see a counselor from school.  It helped to speak to someone about what's truly burdening you.  Trust me, you're not judged. You're not alone. Call that hotline please.  You can even give a fake name if you'd like, but give yourself the chance to release everything you've been bottling up.\nYou already took that step forward to make this post. Please keep going."

    "responses":[ "Keep at it. Your depression, like mine, was years and years in the making and reinforcing. \n\nThe strategy I took is unique. After about decade of outside help, I asked myself, \"Doing what I am doing, am I getting the results I want to get?\" \n\n(At this point in my life I was barely making money, catering to every whim of an ogre narcissist, and on the verge of failing to pay my bills and rent, and would lose custody of my kids with no residence. My kids were no the ogre's kids. The ogre almost dumped me of at an ER to be commited for a sucidal breakdown once already, but chickened out because he wouldn't get access to my child support money any more.)\n\nThe medicine made me feel jitter and jumpy and caused a racing heart at \"regular doses\"], so i was reduced to a bare minimun dose, so I don't think the drug manage my depression much. \n\nTherapy was a place I went to and he or she let me talk. I felt like 95% of the therapy was what I would say to the mirror after reading a self-help article of Better Homes and Gardens. \n\nI have a BA in psychology. I decided to add real beain science to my anti-depression crusade. \n\nI experienced my depression setting up camp in my brain as a 7 year old child, with a fairly simple life of school, a pet hermit crab, and little else. No friends a single toddler sibling , and hand-off, detachment parents. \n\nI remember distinctly the Automatic Negative Thoughts coming from the back\/rear of my head. The part of my head the tried in vein to counter the ANTs was the front part, the Prefrontal Cortex, as I much later learned. \n\nThe back and front were at war. Every night, I'd sob in seething pain of hating to be alive and in shame and seering guilt of feeling the way I felt. I hid it from my parents, although it was not hard. \n\nMy mental picture of it all was like that of the \"Last Judgement\" with the horrors of hell at the bottom and the goodness of Jesus and heven up top, like the back\/bottom of my head and front\/top of my head. \n\nFast forward to my mid 40's and being on the bring of committed to an institution. \n\nI knew from my experience as a child, that the depression had a source in the brain. I looked at brain anatomy and best I can I dentify, it is from the area of the Limbic System and Dorsal Raphe Nucleus. (LS and DRN) \n\nIt was like the LS has a megaphone in my head and the PFC wispered. Or, as if in the war in my head, the LS had rocket laungers and M80's  and the PFC had bb guns. TOTAL IMBALANCE.\n\nSo, as I explained, I sought out to balance the volume of the LS and PFC. \n\nFrom my classes in college, I k ew about neurons, a bit about how they fire in sequence and wire together and how \"muscle memory\" can trigger reflexive firing, luke when we tire our shoes. With repetition, executing the action of tying our shoes does not require the step-by-step thought process.\n\nTurns out, it takes a certain number of hours of specific practice to get a certain chain of neuron to wire together. I. 10 hours, you have a pretty good wiring, and with thousands of hours you are considered a \"professional\" or a \" master\" at something. Well, guess how many hours in our lifetime we have spent \"mastering\" our depression? Especially in relation to hours spent on a specific depression counter-measure. It's numbers. 5, 6, 7 hours is nothing to judge success by when I know my brain has been actively supporting its own depressive habits for THOUSANDS of hours since I was 7 years old. \n\nSo, I took the approach of training like an athlete trains for an upcoming sports season. \n\nSuppose would- be soccer player \"Chris\" gets some shin guards and soccer shoes, reads up a bit on soccer rules, and practices moves 45 minutes per week in the 6 weeks preceding the first game.\n\nSuppose would-be soccer player \"Pat\" gets some shin guards, shoes and learns the rules also, but practices every single day. Time spent learning to dribble the ball up and down the field, defend around oponent, headiing an incoming ball, etc. If \"Pat's\" total minutes of specific practice on repeating a single move of maneuvering the ball around a cone in practice is a total of 15 minutes a day, times 4 days a week time 6 weeks of pre-season, Pat has accumulated 6 hous of specific practice on that maneuver.\n\nWho is going to be more ready to perform as a soccer player at the first game?? \n\n(The analogy is that I am the would-be soccer player and the 1st game is an looming depressive episode.)\n\nWhat I had to to was bring elements of purely OBJECTIVE reality into my anti-depressive crusade. \"X\" number of minutes doing my \"in control\" exercise was one of those objective elements.\n\nNothing from my verious therapists was ever that kind of specific. It was always \"well, how do you feel after.... \" \"how do you feel since...\" \"how are you feeling....\"  Newsflash: reporting a \"feeling\" is completey subjective. \n\nI needed balance in subjective and objective. Not all or nothing, just some of each. \n\nIt turns out, that is the key to overcomi g depression, too. Balance between the volume and authority of the various areas of our brains."

You don't have to walk around thinking your farts don't stink or make lists of the things you like about yourself. \n\nStep 1 is silencing the voice in your head that tells you all the mean things that make you hate yourself. Recognize those thoughts and shut them down before they finish. I read somewhere that the best way to do it is to try your best every day. And your best is different every day, and that's ok. That way when the voice starts up you can always counter it with \"hey, I'm trying my best!\" That's the most you can ask of yourself. Try your best and invalidate the voice.\n\nStep 2 is a bunch of baby steps. What do you want to change about yourself? Don't make a list. Pick the very first thing that pops in your head. And little by little, work to change it. You don't have to fix it in a day. Just do your best. Then move on to the next thing, but only when you're ready.\n\nEventually, maybe you won't love yourself, but you'll be more confident and in a better place."

I managed to overcome my darker periods by reaching out to people who had the same experience. In my opinion, the most important thing someone suffering from a depression needs is support.

I am also a big brother to twins (13 year olds), which might not be a viable profession, but I feel that my brother and sister often reach out to me when they need someone to talk to. I am there when they need to vent or rant and I am always open to listen to what's on their mind and in their hearts.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* WHY do you think you have the right personality to fairly enforce the rules and policies in a mature manner?\n\nApart from the above mentioned experience with depression, I am also a people-person. I love helping people and being there for people who need it most. People on this sub want to get better and enjoy life, but unfortunately there are many people who leave rude comments, not knowing the impact they may have on those already struggling. Since you never know 100% what the reason behind a comment or posts is, those who break the rules have to be removed. By addressing the user and explaining clearly why their post was removed, this sub can remain a friendly and safe environment for people seeking help and those who are willing to help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* If a post became popular but it violated a rule or two, what would you do?\n\nRemove it. Popularity is great and all, but if a post violates the rules, it has to be removed. Otherwise there might as well be no rules at all. I would remove the post, but give the user clear and detailed information why his\/her post was removed so they can learn from their mistakes and abide by the rules next time they post."

I.e., don't rely on the idea that it's ok I'll procrastinate but I'll eventually panic near the end and get everything done. The reason is that the more one procrastinates the more one becomes resistant to panic. Rely on your logic. You already have a plan of what you can salvage. Sit down for 10 more minutes and reaffirm it, and that's it.\n\n\\- Practical \"tricks\" do help. Obviously don't spend the whole day clearing everything but clear your desk for sure. Logout from all sorts of social media, if your phone rings too much disable it. In general set aside anything that can distract you. It's ok getting distracted from time time but no reason to not make an effort to minimize this.\n\n\\- It does get easier after a certain time. Start for an hour, make a short break and continue. It will then get a bit harder again (relatively sooner than people used to working longer) but if you make another concsious effort to stay on the task you'll be fine.\n\n\\- Tell someone you respect that you are doing this and it is really important that you do not fail and can check up on you. Maybe it's a parent, maybe some good friends, a professor. You can try me. I'm an academic, and I'll be really disappointed in your sorry ass. *Alternatively :* if the above does not work for you I'll go out on a limb and say your ego does not let you be held accountable to others.

That's fine. Forget any sings of guilt you might be having because it was you just being smart. But this will get out of hand if it continues and you need to stop it here, trust me.\n\n\\- There's fear of (im)perfection. If you find yourself lingering too much over one thing snap out of it. Just make it good enough.\n\n\\- There's fear of failure. Oh no no, I don't mean you are afraid you'll fail your classes even though you tried, you're too smart for that.

    "responses":[ "I think you kind of missed the point about the work outs and diets. The workouts allow you to have some “bilateral stimulation” which helps your brain create endorphins. (Do some research on it! It’s pretty interesting.) The diets allow you have a proper amount of nutrients which provide your brain extra (leftover) energy to produce “happy” hormones.\n\nNothing gets better either. Life has its ups and downs. That’s just it. It just gets somewhat easier to deal with it. Those of us dealing with depression for a long time just end up using those ridiculously rough patches to grow and learn to deal with it better. We learned to set our expectations low and realistic. \n\nMedications work, but eventually you realize that therapy is also needed. You can’t always help your depression from your first person view. Having a therapist means having a third party view, which allows them to assess the situation more clearly and help you identify your problems better. \n\nLife is tough, but eventually you have to get up and start fighting the monster called depression. Yes, it’s tough to do but you’ll get better at it. One day you look back, and you’ll see how much you’ve grown."

It can be due to trauma (like being bullied or abused, or brain injury), or it can be a shortage of serotonin (as in my case).  it is not uncommon that even the best diet and exercise and relationships don’t help enough for a person to cope.  In my case, my coping strategies (including workaholism)  stopped working eventually, and i needed medication and hormone therapy.  It has made a huge positive difference.  \n\nIf your parents don’t understand depression is an actual illness  — and many people don’t — perhaps a supportive relative or friend can try to explain, or you can offer them some written or video information.  \n\nIf your family has access to a doctor, a check-up with a general practice doctor is a very, very good idea.  Depression can also be caused by an underlying health problem, like thyroid problems, anemia, or an infection.  Try to describe accurately what you are feeling physically or emotionally.  He\/she could rule out more benign causes, help explain to your parents, and refer you for mental health evaluation and treatment.  \n\nI am sorry your parents don’t understand (yet?). I am 54, successful in my career, i have a good family, and good relationships, but it still stings when my 78-year-old mom doesn’t get why i need medication.  I remember that she loves me to the best of her ability, and that helps.  \n\nYou are right in thinking exercise helps - it does - but don’t  feel bad if you find it hard to keep up.  Be modest in your goals at first and pat yourself on the back for your progress. Everyone’s willpower is finite and you probably use most of yours up getting through the day - depression saps your energy.  I find it helps to hook a new habit you want to build to an already established habit or routine. For example, i know i won’t forget to brush my teeth, so I do knee bends for the two minutes while my electric toothbrush is going.  \n\nYou are right to eat well no matter what your body shape — try to resist toxic messages around you on what your body should look like, and try to focus in feeling well.  To the degree you can, dress and cut your hair to emphasize your best features - you do have them.   Look at photos of good looking people whose frame and coloring resembles yours and try similar clothes and hair, with special attention to shape and proportion.  But also pay attention to how many people are not attractive by any conventional standard, and who are very fulfilled in their lives.  \n\nGood rule of thumb for reducing negative self-talk:  if you wouldn’t say it to your best friend, don’t say it to yourself. \n\nAnd there is some silver lining.  my problems have taught me compassion for others, and my (over)sensitivity has allowed me to notice important things other people miss.  This has served me really well out in the wider world beyond school.  \n\nGet some medical help if you can, educate yourself about managing your mental and physical health, and remember that you can still make a great success of your life.   Take good care of yourself.  *hug*"

He\/she could rule out more benign causes, help explain to your parents, and refer you for mental health evaluation and treatment.  \n\nI am sorry your parents don’t understand (yet?). I am 54, successful in my career, i have a good family, and good relationships, but it still stings when my 78-year-old mom doesn’t get why i need medication.  I remember that she loves me to the best of her ability, and that helps.  \n\nYou are right in thinking exercise helps - it does - but don’t  feel bad if you find it hard to keep up.  Be modest in your goals at first and pat yourself on the back for your progress. Everyone’s willpower is finite and you probably use most of yours up getting through the day - depression saps your energy.  I find it helps to hook a new habit you want to build to an already established habit or routine. For example, i know i won’t forget to brush my teeth, so I do knee bends for the two minutes while my electric toothbrush is going.  \n\nYou are right to eat well no matter what your body shape — try to resist toxic messages around you on what your body should look like, and try to focus in feeling well.  To the degree you can, dress and cut your hair to emphasize your best features - you do have them.   Look at photos of good looking people whose frame and coloring resembles yours and try similar clothes and hair, with special attention to shape and proportion.  But also pay attention to how many people are not attractive by any conventional standard, and who are very fulfilled in their lives.  \n\nGood rule of thumb for reducing negative self-talk:  if you wouldn’t say it to your best friend, don’t say it to yourself. \n\nAnd there is some silver lining.  my problems have taught me compassion for others, and my (over)sensitivity has allowed me to notice important things other people miss.  This has served me really well out in the wider world beyond school.  \n\nGet some medical help if you can, educate yourself about managing your mental and physical health, and remember that you can still make a great success of your life.   Take good care of yourself.  *hug*"],

If you just want to vent feel free to. Also, if you have the means to, I suggest taking this opportunity to go to cognitive behavioral therapy. The feelings that are making you fall so head over heels over this girl might be partly due to some illogical thought process of yours, and I cant recommend CBT enough to try to tear those out root and stem.\n\nMy biggest advice is to work out though.

I as well actually have problems with being able to express myself clearly, which is bad cause I'm a business major so I'm doing my best to help this problem and trying to help others as well along the way. And you are heading in the right direction by asking those around you (like your significant other) but something we gotta keeping mind is that they want to help us, they really do, but they aren't therapists. And actually thats what therapy is for, so that you can talk as unclear as you want because that might just be a clue to finding a solution for your mental illness, I go to therapy and I literally just unravel there, I tell them the full story because I want to solve my mental illness problem, and the only way for that to happen is if both the doctor and the patient know the full story so that we can get to the source and solve the problem, and from there its just a matter of keeping up with things the therapist tells you and with time things will get better, because we haven't given up since we're still here in the world, we're still getting back up after a hit of life so we aren't down for the count, and we aren't alone, I guarantee theres many more like us out there, part of the reason why this subreddit was made in the first place"

    "responses":[ "Hey there! So basically, your stomach has shrunk so much and there’s a lot of stomach acid. \n\nWhat I recommend is:\n1) Eat some pepto bismol before your meals. Pepto Bismol is a base and will neutralize you stomach acid and make some room for some real food. \n\n2) Start off with small meals. Eat a 3:1:1 ratio of Vegetables, Meat, and Carbs. Or if it’s really severe, drink some soup.\n\nHere’s a soup recipe I recommend:\n\nPork soup:\nIngredients: Ground pork, soy sauce, napa cabbage\/spinach, water, and rice\n\nRice:\n1. Measure out a cup and wash the rice. (Just water. No soap.) Use your hand to swirl the water in the bowl and clean off any dirt on the rice. Don’t keep washing the rice until the water is clear. It takes the nutrients away from the rice.\n\n2. Measure out the water you use. I generally let the rice sit and use the end to the middle (before first knuckle) of my pinky finger to measure the amount of water. (Look on YouTube if you need help.) \n\n3. Cook rice. Pot or rice cooker, both work. Pot you’ll need to cover and watch. It will burn if you aren’t careful.\n\nSoup:\n1. Make ground pork balls. Smaller = Less cooking time.\n2. Boil water and add veggies. Add the pork and some soy sauce. (Add the soy sauce very scarcely. You can always add more soy sauce later, but you can’t subtract it.) \n3. Wait until the pork floats at the top. \n4. Serve and enjoy.\n\nTake small steps at a time. It’ll become a bit easier with each meal you eat. Best of luck!"

However, a good therapist should know that their guiding theory won't work with every client and they should either a)try something different or b) refer you elsewhere. It doesn't surprise me that they both use the same method if they're out of the same clinic.

It all depends on what type of mental illness you have. Maybe CBD can help, I wouldn’t know because I no longer choose to partake in ever trying drugs again. I’d rather deal with anxiety on my own than rely on taking a drug everytime I freak out. My sister’s husband has slight anxiety when going out in public and takes CBD lol and he’s fine. His anxiety is not enough to need to go therapy for, so he’s told me last month. \n\nBasically, a lot of factors go into it. To answer your actual question in your patterns, I’m assuming most therapists choose not to do so because to be fair, they’ve studied the mind and behavior more than the average person has and they know more science behind it, especially psychologists who specialize in drug addiction and behavioral health from drugs (can’t remember the exact name, but my last therapist did this). I guarantee you that most therapists disagree with psychedelic use when they have a patient taking antidepressants\/antipsychotics\/benzodiazepines, etc. It’s common sense to not take a psychedelic while on those medications.

Abuse isn’t always physical, although once it becomes this you increasingly are at risk of more serious injury or even death. Abuse can be coercive control like limiting who you see, where you go, what you wear, and how you feel about yourself. The goal is to break you until you are dependent only on him and under his thumb. \n\nSweet girl, you are in danger. And you don’t deserve it. You must seek help.

It's hard for our family members to do that because all of our feelings are too tied together.\n\nIf you see a therapist, you won't have to say all of this to them right away. You can just say \"I feel really overwhelmed and unhappy and it's taking a toll on my marriage and I don't really know what to do.\" Lots of people show up to therapy and barely speak. The therapist will ask you questions and you can talk about whatever comes up for you. As you see them and come to feel more comfortable with them, you can share more. Their job is to help you make an overwhelming huge problem into manageable, understandable issues you can deal with. \n\nCouples counseling might be pretty helpful too. Not because your relationship needs work, but going into therapy together might feel pretty empowering for both of you. It could make you feel like you're both on the same team. Instead of talking about your contributions vs hers, you could just both talk to the therapist about shared concerns, like how does your current financial situation feel? How does it change how you act toward each other? What could you do together to fix some of the stuff you're both going through?"]

    "responses":[ "If you're in America there are a few ways to go about this. I suggest the best way is word of mouth. If you have any friends who see a therapist you could use them as a referral. Often therapists' schedules will fluctuate whether or not they are taking new clients so it can be tricky. If the therapist is part of a clinic they may refer to another therapist in house. This method may open doors that would otherwise be closed. The only consideration is if the referring friend is a pivotal figure in your life. If so the therapist may consider it a conflict of interest and refer (hopefully) in house to another therapist.\n\nIf you have insurance you can call them and they will give you a list of therapists in your network. Also, if you are currently working or a dependent of someone who is working they may have employee assistance programs (EAP) which sets a person up with a therapist (3-8 sessions covered). \n\nOtherwise, websites like PsychologyToday can help you search for therapists and filter for insurance, speciality, and location.\n\nLastly, if you are struggling to find someone check out SAMHSA or NAMI. They often have open support groups and you may find one specific to your needs."

I personally feel (from my anecdotal experience) that even though some of the stigma has been reduced regarding men coming forward about their emotions, there's also less grey area and more extreme opinions being spread across the media... so there are a lot of people who say \"yes, absolutely men should come forward if they're feeling depressed and have issues to work through\" and a lot of people saying \"absolutely not, why in the world cant he just buck up and deal with it?\" and not many people in between. \n\nTherefore, if someone is seeking therapy, they might be returning to a stigmatizing social group or home life. Or, they come from a stigmatizing or radicalized social group and don't try to seek help. The men I've seen who make the most progress in therapy also have an incredible support group outside of their counselor or therapy group, and those who struggle tend to return to their poor habits or unhealthy environments when they leave counseling and feel as though they're not able to find healthier relationships.\n\nAnother important consideration is the methods men and women tend to use to complete suicide. Men tend to use more lethal methods (gun wounds, hanging, jumping) and women tend to use less lethal methods (cutting, pills). The generally accepted statistics regarding suicide in the US states that 3x as many men complete suicide and 3x as many women attempt suicide. So there are generally the same amount of individuals who have a desire to contemplate suicide but the running theory is that men actually complete more frequently is due to the severity of their attempts."

    "responses":[ "I appreciate what you've written here. The stats regarding suicide attempts in your last paragraph aren't news to me, but should be a part of this thread nonetheless. You're right about the extreme opinions in the media, and there being little in between.   \nHere in Australia we don't get much of the \"buck up and deal with it\" stuff anymore...instead every media personality spouts the same thing regarding \"Men need to open up more\". \n\nIf that *is* all that men *need* to be doing, then our suicide rate here should be getting better surely, even if just a tiny bit? Because men *are* opening up more. Slowly, yes, but we definitely have more men \"opening up\" more now than we used to.\n\nWe have a long way to go, but today we have so much more encouragement than we used to regarding mental health treatment, yet the rate of suicide is getting worse.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm wondering if there is any correlation between the the rise of male suicide and the changing definition of what it means to be masculine\/a man."

She's also in a different country so I'm really not sure how it would work to put up all this legal action internationally. It's even worse that I will be going to the same country she's in for university and our universities are next to each other\/in the same area (Seoul, SK.)\n\nI can do a few things; change my number as well as try and get a therapist. Maybe I'll discuss this with her older brother, or her mom. At the same time, I'm not sure if that's the right thing for me to do either... I really don't know. \n\nI'll probably go back and screenshot everything I have with her, chats, just in case she tries to pin things on me or expose them online. For whatever reasons that she would do that. \n\nI am afraid to tell my parents because they're pretty Asian and will probably get mad at me for being dumb enough to believe any of this or for even letting someone get to me. They won't let me go overseas for university either because they won't think I'm good enough anymore if I admit this to them. \n\nI haven't had much support on this because I've been scared to tell people in fear of being judged. You're extremely right that I've been judging myself the most, and I've tried to tell others about this but it always ends up with \"Please don't judge me, I can't believe how stupid I was.\" Right now, I still believe that but at the same time,  I'm really just looking for support. \n\nYou've given me a lot of support through this message, and I'm so grateful.

I know you mentioned that when you took your medication consistently for 3 months, your \"episodes\" reduced, so that's a good sign that your medication is helping your symptoms. \n\nAnother good thing to add to your daily routine is moments of mindfulness. You can coordinate this with the time you take your medication as well! Let your husband (or whoever else might interrupt) know that you're going to take 5 minutes that need to be uninterrupted. You can sit in a comfortable position, put on some music without words, close your eyes, and focus on how your body feels. Focus on the way your bottom feels on the surface your sitting on, your feet or legs on the floor, the weight of your arms, or the weight of your head on your neck. If your mind wanders to the dishes or any concerns, acknowledge the thought but refocus on your 5 senses. I know it sounds kind of \"hippy\" but it really helps to connect your brain with your body and you can use those skills over time to calm your mind when you have a feeling of becoming overwhelmed. So when you see those dishes piling up and you start to become anxious, bring yourself back into the present moment and refocus on your body for a moment before deciding how you want to handle the situation.\n\nI hope this is helpful! If you'd like to start going to therapy, there are some therapists who will do therapy out of pocket or offer \"sliding scale\" payments which are based on your income."

It’s been hard and slow to accept that I have trauma that has left me depressed and anxious as an adult.  But gosh, once I started to accept that it was trauma (still unsure about if it was abuse) and learn about trauma, wow - everything makes much more sense. I actually feel better knowing what I’m experiencing has a name (trauma), it’s unfortunately common (see this sub) and there are therapies available to heal from it. I’m working with an EMDr therapist to process certain things from childhood. I also hope to do mdma sometime soon.

    "responses":[ "It's good to hear you have good boundaries in other areas of your life! That means you have a good gauge for who you feel you can trust with \"rejection.\" That might be a good thing for you to consider when you do start seeing someone romantically; when you feel your potential romantic partner is crossing a boundary or you should say \"no,\" ask yourself \"if this were [friend] asking this, would I say no?\" If you would say no to anyone else, say no to them. You have to learn their level of rejection perception and it's not fair for you to assume your partner can't handle rejection (and as you've learned, it only reinforces negative behaviors).\n\nYou can also reflect on the times you said yes when you should have said no and imagine how you could have said no-- *not* as an effort to rekindle anything, but as a practice for when you need to say no to a new partner. \n\nHaving a firm schedule is a good way to make sure you're not becoming too clingy or being a people pleaser as well. If you decide to workout from 7-8pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, or you make a plan with a friend, commit to it. If a non-emergency comes up and your partner wants to hang out-- \"I have to go to the gym, but I can hang out [other time].\" Major life events might deviate this schedule, but setting the schedule before you enter a potential partnership and holding true to it through courting and dating is a good way to establish to your partner your boundaries and ensure you have time to remember the things that are important to you. If your potential partner wigs out over this, red flag alert. \n\nIt can also be helpful to talk to friends about it. Let me give you a hypothetical, I hope it's not too obtuse or abstract: you decide to meet up for dinner and drinks with a friend you haven't seen in a month. Your partner texts to hang out instead but you tell them \"I have plans with Jimmy, but I'm free tomorrow at 6!\" Partner replies saying, \"that's really selfish of you, I really just want to spend time with you and you're not here for me,\" but doesn't have a legitimate reason (no death in the family, they're not ill, etc) for you choosing to hang out with partner over your friend who you have had plans with for 2 weeks.

    "patterns":["It's good to hear you have good boundaries in other areas of your life! That means you have a good gauge for who you feel you can trust with \"rejection.\" That might be a good thing for you to consider when you do start seeing someone romantically; when you feel your potential romantic partner is crossing a boundary or you should say \"no,\" ask yourself \"if this were [friend] asking this, would I say no?\" If you would say no to anyone else, say no to them. You have to learn their level of rejection perception and it's not fair for you to assume your partner can't handle rejection (and as you've learned, it only reinforces negative behaviors).\n\nYou can also reflect on the times you said yes when you should have said no and imagine how you could have said no-- *not* as an effort to rekindle anything, but as a practice for when you need to say no to a new partner. \n\nHaving a firm schedule is a good way to make sure you're not becoming too clingy or being a people pleaser as well. If you decide to workout from 7-8pm on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays, or you make a plan with a friend, commit to it. If a non-emergency comes up and your partner wants to hang out-- \"I have to go to the gym, but I can hang out [other time].\" Major life events might deviate this schedule, but setting the schedule before you enter a potential partnership and holding true to it through courting and dating is a good way to establish to your partner your boundaries and ensure you have time to remember the things that are important to you. If your potential partner wigs out over this, red flag alert. \n\nIt can also be helpful to talk to friends about it. Let me give you a hypothetical, I hope it's not too obtuse or abstract: you decide to meet up for dinner and drinks with a friend you haven't seen in a month. Your partner texts to hang out instead but you tell them \"I have plans with Jimmy, but I'm free tomorrow at 6!\" Partner replies saying, \"that's really selfish of you, I really just want to spend time with you and you're not here for me,\" but doesn't have a legitimate reason (no death in the family, they're not ill, etc) for you choosing to hang out with partner over your friend who you have had plans with for 2 weeks.

Anything from waking up in the morning and looking in the mirror and think \"wow, the bags under my eyes are terrible today,\" to feeling down about your performance at work. Combat every negative thought about yourself with 5 good thoughts. \n\nIf you can't shake the negative thought, think about if it's something you're able to change. You mentioned you go to the gym, so if it's a body image concern, commit to going more frequently or looking up healthy workout and diet plans. If you have the money, see a nutritionist or trainer to tailor a workout and diet plan that fits your goals.\n\nTake some time every day to be mindful. That could be meditation, or even just admiring nature. Don't time yourself, and set an alarm if you have something to do at a particular time so you dont get lost in the moment. Enjoying life and the people and things around me has greatly increased my own quality of life.\n\nDo you have any hobbies? I cant recall at the moment, but there's a sub for inexpensive\/free hobbies. You can always try something new, of course being aware that you're not going to be great right away, but it can feel good to cultivate a skill."

Do you eventually work through all the negative spots and heal the trauma? Or is it just to be informed of what’s off limits for good? \n\nThat’s great, I did 16 weeks of DBT and found it really challenging but super helpful so it would be really good to utilise that in the treatment and help retrain my brain. \n\nThose are honestly my main priorities in life and I’ve been working on really refining those areas as much as I can at a healthy pace for the past few years and it’s been making a world of difference.

This will probably be bad advise because I'm not educated and I don't know the situation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I was you, I probably have already learned how to partition your personalities. Keeping the hurt and fear away from the public and only showing the happy and carefree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUse that. When you're feeling like less than worth existing, use it to treat yourself to an experience that you think someone (you may think) is better than you. Masquerade as an amazing person with an interesting life. Use your ability to 'create happiness' and 'portray joy' to show yourself what it looks like. Instead of using it to perform for others, perform only for yourself. If you don't feel the motivation to perform or you feel that you're not worthy of the performance.. then practice for the big show. Practice for when you feel like you're worth it. Practice it until you are a professional at being happy and carefree.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would first try getting a gourmet meal at a 3-5 star fine dining restaurant. Order the special. Let yourself enjoy it. Don't let others looks discourage yourself.

I would image I'm the royalty, or member of the court, or a servant... any of them that would be fine, I would be chronically the scandals and secrets and odd interactions because I'm the only one above all of them and I'm able to view their network of whispers in their fullness.\n\nI would try to say hello to a stranger, maybe a smile. Especially an older person that may be at the end of a long day or a person that I pass in the store. Not for anything but knowing that people tend to smile back or get a moment of subconscious joy when someone smiles or says hi to them. I would know that I am bringing positivity to others just by catching their attention with a smile, a hi, or a thank you. That's pretty much 'just existing'. by 'just existing' I am bringing joy to others. Acknowledge that, keep it close to your heart, let yourself believe it.\n\nVolunteer at a pet shelter. Wash a dog, walk a dog, let the dogs know you'll be back to give them a good scratch. Learn how you can volunteer with training them or posting media online or offline to help them get adopted.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLastly, but should really be first, consult a therapist professional. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this helps and\/or inspires something helpful in you"

    "responses":[ "This. Having gone through this an a similar situation, you need to learn to let go after a while. An emotionally abusive mother is just that, and while it is absolutely heartbreaking to have to witness, there really isn't much that you can do. You cant fix the other parent, and chances are you cant fix the situatuon because it is very, very hard to prove. The mother is unavailable because the child is her source of validation. Is it awful? Yes. Can you prove it? Doubtful. Will the child be okay? Probably.\n\nI cannot stress enough that the most important thing you can do is learn to let go. Dont fixate. You cannot change the circumstances he's in there. Trust me. But you can show him real love, you can show him stability, you can show him happiness. My best advice having been in your shoes is for dad to be the best damned dad he can be, and you to be the best stepmom you can be. You will not, can not and should not replace mom. But you can be an ally, you can be a friend, you can be a positive maternal figure. And in the end, it will act as a balance to the less than perfect situation he has there.\n\nStay out of it. Dont mention his mom. Just love and support him in those moments. You can be frustrated and upset when you see this happen, which you will be because you love this child. But that is your burden, and it needs to stay with you. Just focus on yourself, your home, and the life you build with him when he's there. Accept what you cant fix and trust what you can give."

Thank you for submitting it! \n\n\\[For some context, I'm new to reddit, trained as a clinical social worker, and currently work as a behavioral health clinician in an integrated care setting to provide short-term counseling to pediatric and adult patients\\]\n\nI suppose a way to explore this is to practice identifying and sitting with your personal motivations. What drives you to work out? What does exercise mean to you? What have your exercise patterns been over time? Have they changed?  If so, what else was going on around those times? What external messages about your body\/lifestyle\/routines do you receive or believe you might be susceptible to based on your life experience?\n\nOnce we've marinated on that, I wonder if it could be helpful to explore what feelings or emotions are tied to those motivations. For example, if the thought is, \"I'm driven to work out because I want to be more toned,\" an associated feeling could be anything from anxiety (\"I'm anxious because my body doesn't look like I want it to.\") to inspired (\"I have access to equipment and am excited to see what my body is capable of!\"). These are just examples.\n\nThe point is our thoughts about a thing impact our feelings about ourselves + others + the world which then inform how we behave. \n\nThere are endless competing messages circulating about what a person should or shouldn't do with their body. It's no surprise navigating this would cause personal reflection or even distress. You know yourself best. It's cool you're thinking this through and I wish you kindness to both your mind and body as you explore it!  \n\nInterested to hear others' thoughts, as well, and happy to post some resources related to body image, shame, eating behaviors, etc. if desired."

One technique that comes to mind is CBT, which you can actually look at online - particularly cognitive restructuring which is basically challenging your negative thoughts about yourself to more realistic ones.  Self-doubt is totally natural, but it does become unhealthy when it’s impacting your mood and your self esteem.\n\nThe other thing you could try is journaling, or keeping a notebook.  One option is writing down your feelings (journaling is seriously good therapy).  The other idea is writing down what you did well.  What are the things you’re proud of today? What are the things that can boop future self doubt on the head?  It might feel weird at first, but getting yourself into that pattern and seeing things on paper can make a world of difference.\n\nGood luck."

    "responses":[ "This!  Upvoted.  OP, from what you're saying, certainly sounds like it.  \n\n\nA panic attack has nothing to do with overreacting.  By the time anyone has a panic attack, it's completely out of their control.  Essentially what happens is that all of your adrenaline gets dumped into your bloodstream at once.  Once this happens, all you can try to do is use coping skills to make yourself as comfortable as you can until it passes.  No matter how bad, it will always pass with time because the adrenaline doesn't stay effective for very long and most folks bodies don't produce it quickly enough to keep it pumping for long once you've used up all your stores.  \n\n\nYou can't prevent or stop it once it's started, however you can take steps to make sure you don't get to that point beforehand and make plans so you know exactly what to do to make yourself as comfortable as possible if\/when it happens."

Attachment can also be shaped from later in life - like the relationships with students, teachers etc, the way we think, feel and the environment that we grow up in.

One thing that maybe still seems confusing to you is that your therapist embraced your promiscuity (praising you for having sex with new partners), but to me that reads as being sex positive.

Some people manage to get the balance \"just right,\" but they are too perfect.

    "responses":[ "hi again, thanks for taking the time to share your thoughts. here's the problem: thoughts are not everything. they do not make us either fully intelligent, nor fully human. humans, and other animals, are by nature both reason + feeling beings, plus will (choice\/decision\/commitment to values). \n\nyou must decide to be humble- you've already expressed great capacity to do this and to overcome your ego in the past an avoid puffing yourself up- and in doing this, you will become a student of life, and of emotions. \n\ndeciding to become (falsely) unemotional is not a solution, just like deciding not to eat would be unhealthy. you must choose to learn, study (not as a therapist, as a human being committed to growth and health), and seek support and help in doing so. that way, you will not allow yourself (will) certain behaviors based on emotion, including your fear of emotion which has led you to try to cut it off completely. it's okay at the time, you didn't realize, and your mother and therapist didn't either. you were probably good at convincing her and yourself, but it wasn't an honest choice, since you clearly needed to grow and be supported, like we all do. \n\nit's okay and normal to be overwhelmed and scared when we're learning something-- it's natural. strong people embrace that fear and feel it, and do the right thing and the courageous thing, which is to ignore the ego and choose to love and grow. to do that, like when you learn a new sport or a new subject at school, you get good books, you study, you practice, and you get good teachers. and you accept the discomfort and the struggle, right? it doesn't stop you from wanting to get good at it. emotions are no different, and even more important :) you'll become a martial artist of happiness and connection and joy. of satisfaction, pride in who you are as a character, and peace.\n\ninstead, by blocking emotions and stopping support, you actually accidentally stunted your growth, like stopping taking vitamins. reading more about your experience with your therapist, it sounds like the writing down of all the emotions, and then abruptly stopping therapy, was overwhelming. you chose to intellectualize and decide to block them. that is not a healthy or sustainable choice. finances would have been better spent on your future through therapy. your future is not financial\/acadmemic, but the whole reality of your mental-emotional-physical health, which are all related. \n\nintellectualization and denial are defenses which do not serve us long-term.\ntherapy and working on ourselves helps us develop real coping skills which allow us to thrive, not just get by. right now, that is what you get to choose to do-- thrive, and stop just surviving, because you woke up to the truth that something is not right in your choice, years ago, to defend against your emotions by trying to shut them down.\n\nclarification: going to therapy does NOT mean one has mental illness. it means one is smart, recognizes areas that need to grow, and finds a way to heal and grow them faster and better through support. it's a sign of strength and intelligence to know our limitations and seek to grow. period.\n\ntrauma: is difficult, taxing experience. and it does not always have immediate noticeable effects. it also accumulates over time. and can be suddenly coming to a crisis like the one you had when you decided to shut down and stop therapy. that choice was also a defense-- you intellectualized it was financial, but it was fear of doing the work and being uncomfortable, too. and both of those feelings are okay and normal, but we have to choose to grow, and that requires us choosing to be humble and be students of life to learn how to handle our emotions healthily. \n\nin fact, your mentioning \"if you were to\" take a life is an indication of what happens when we make unhealthy, defensive choices in dealing with our emotions: we stop functioning intelligently and well. you must decide that will never be an option, no matter how you feel or don't feel. that's will. and then, you work to awaken your natural, inborn emotional intelligence by learning, getting support, and practicing, one day at a time.\n\nthat's how to avoid mental illness, suffering, and poor life choices. you cannot talk about a future without talking about yourself as a whole, emotional+mental+physical+spiritual person. that's true for all of us. you've got a great heart, now grow it, and grow it up into the love you are and were born to feel."
